Although the "R" rating is much needed due to the graphic nature of this film, it is a nice directorial effort by Mel Gibson. This actor turned actor/director has made a fine film here. He has had such a successful acting career that this is obviously an outlet for his phenomenal creative talents to flourish. Whomever thought the goofball from "Lethal Weapon 1" could create Braveheart, Passion Of The Christ, and now Apocolypto? Maybe he has seen too many bad movies and wants to give the audience more. Give Us More Mel! And Take Your Time Making The Best Films! Perhaps "Mad Max 4".<br /> Some do not agree with the historical accuracy of the movie, but how many are totally accurate. Written history has questionable accuracy..since it is written through the eyes of the writer him/herself.<br /> The acting, scenery, and story all make for an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride all the way. I had to freeze the DVD several times to admire spectacular visions. Over 2 hours, seems like 1.5 hours because it's that good.
First off when this film first came out the teaser was misleading, the trailer also does not really leads the viewer to what this movie is about. The poster does not help either. My impression was, this movie is some Sci-Fi fantasy about Maya, probably something not close, but similar to "Stargate". The poster even made me think of "Alien vs. Predator".<br /><br />Instead the movie is portraying the ancient world of Mesoamerican people, as well as tracking the end of the ancient civilizations, through the story of Jaguar's Paw - a captured warrior in a rescue to his family. It doesn't portray the fall of the Mayan Empire, it's not supposed to, it just tells a story, It does not set out to be a history of the arrival of European's in the Mayan area. Horrific as it may be, it's a love story at the end of the day along with a lot of action. Even then, much of the violence is Shakespearean and takes place just off-camera. For instance, you see women being carried off in the rape-and-pillage scene and you hear their cries but you don't see them being raped and murdered. Battles are staged much as they were in "Braveheart." And yes, there's a beating heart lifted from a sacrificed man's chest by a blood-streaked Mayan shaman, but moviegoers saw the same thing in Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; it got a PG rating and we read no critical hysterics about "lunatic violence." On the whole, you'll see as much blood and gore on the average CSI episode.<br /><br />After watching this film, it probably should have been titled "Jaguar Paw's Great Adventure." The glimpses Gibson provides of Mayan civilization are jaw-dropping. You won't ever see a more convincing cinematic evocation of another time and place in such scope and meticulous detail. Every face seems to have a complete history as Jaguar Paw is marched through the Mayan city. A well-to-do Mayan woman does nothing more than look at the prisoners from her doorway but the story her face tells is voluminous.<br /><br />Mel Gibson has done the impossible. He has created a tale of the Maya's people in different dimension. As an historical observation, the film is brilliant, depicting the violence in most of the movie. Finally, as a work of art, this film is unparalleled. "Apocalypto" will move you. I found it to be one of the most beautiful films I needed to see even though it took me some time to view it but I'm happy that I did. Its dialogue is entirely in Mayan language with English subtitles, a remarkably bold decision by Gibson, and one that pays dividends. On one level it unites an international cast, sparing us any clashing accents, and gives the film a greater sense of authenticity. On another, it forced Gibson and his team into a very visual form of storytelling; even amongst the carnage there are shots of aching beauty. If you still haven't seen it then I suggest you give this one a try. Highly recommended.
First of all i want to complain to AMAZON: PLEASE DONT COVER BLU-RAY DISCS IN SECURITY TAPE. It sticks to the box and does not come off properly. I bought two blu-ray movies and the box of BOTH of them is covered with stupid sticky bits left over from the stupid tape you put on it. SO STOP..<br /><br />Movie is wicked...bluray makes the movie even better... dont like Mel Gibson but he did make a class movie...
Most of the reviews I've read on Apocalypto seem to concern themselves with historical accuracy, imperialism, and racism.<br /><br />I think Apocalypto is a warning to our culture (to any culture, really) about the ultimate fate of a decadent people.  I saw a lot of modern Western culture(the only culture I really know) in Gibson's depiction of the Mayans. Sure, we may not lop people's heads off and make a game out of it, but we do make a sport of violence and sex.  We may not perform human sacrifices, but we do build our own prosperity and happiness on the backs of others.  And, as usual, the poorest of the poor end up doing the jobs nobody else wants.<br /><br />I was also surprised to read that many people interpret the brief appearance of the Spanish as a way of saying, "These people found Jesus and got saved."  I got a different impression on my first viewing.  I felt that Gibson's Mayans had grown to embody the worst aspects of humanity, rather than the best.  They were, in turn, conquered by another society that was just as bad (the conquistadores).  If this were to have been a "finding Jesus" movie, the protagonist would have been the one to find the conquistadores; instead, he wisely sneaks away with his family, and we are left with the understanding that one corrupt culture is supplanted by another.<br /><br />Apocalypto has a lot of beautiful imagery, even if some of that beauty is sickening.  The color, costumes, and makeup of the Mayans are captivating--without words, we are given the sense of many different class levels and religious practices.  Against this beauty is set the bloodletting and violence this culture adores.  The darker aspects of our nature are very seductive and alluring, and Apocalypto does a good job of making the viewer appreciate just how easy it is for us to love the worst aspects of our nature.<br /><br />I started watching this movie with a strong bias against Gibson after sitting through the pornography that was the Passion of the Christ.  I was very surprised to see such an insightful commentary in a Gibson movie.  I would recommend Apocalypto to a discerning viewer.<br /><br />Also, kudos to the one reviewer who caught the strong similarities to Rambo.
I rented this movie not expecting too much from it. After all, it seemed to not get much hoopla from the critics, advertising, etc. And, of course, I did hear the usual putdowns of the movie by Hollywood types who are antagonistic toward Mel Gibson since "The Passion of the Christ."<br />  I love this movie!! Why? It's **original** and **daring**.<br />  Quick--name a movie out within the past twelve months that doesn't have Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Owen Wilson, Nicole Kidman, Meg Ryan, and the rest of the same ol' same ol' blahblahblah "superstars" that people allegedly pay to see star in films. You didn't count very many films without "stars" did you? Here's an example: When "Terminal" came out I rented it **in spite of** the fact that Tom Hanks starred in it. (I'm so tired of Tom Hanks I could puke.) I loved the movie *in spite of* Tom Hanks starring in it! It was a fine story. Yes, Tom Hanks is a fine actor--but there are a lot of other fine actors out there, too. Thank God for Mel Gibson's efforts to find such actors. The screenplay of "Apocalyto" is very original as well. I commend Gibson for his daring.<br />Yes, "The Passion of the Christ" was not perfectly historical (e.g., he put far too little blame on Pilate--who actually bore the main responsibility for Jesus' death--and he basically made Jesus and Mary into perfect little Roman Catholics.) That said, though, I admire Gibson's creativity. He is a genuine artist. Gibson could have easily taken the money from the POC movie and made several bland but profitable movies (starring Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidmans, or any other "A-lister") and made more money off such movies rather than making something as original as "Apocalypo."  That's what the usual movie executive would have done.<br /><br />Thank God Gibson didn't. And thank God for Mel Gibson.<br />Great movie: I only gave it 4 stars though because it's not quite in<br />the same league as the creme of cinematic fare. However, it's a lot better than anything you're likely to see at the theater in 2007.
This is one of those rare films that is both a stunning artistic achievement and a fantastically entertaining story. At its heart are the things Gibson is always concerned with in his films: our divided nature, the fact we can be both hideously cruel and extraordinarily courageous; and how love can be as strong, even stronger, than death. This film really lives in its world, which is both very realistic AND very mythological. yes, there are gruesome scenes, but this wasn't a soft world.<br />I can't speak too highly of the fantastic actors and of the sheer beauty of the settings and the tight structure of the story, and I thought the ending was both surprising and very well brought-off. Bravo!
"Apocalypto" presents a fresh variation on the staple action movie storyline of an Everyman who goes to extraordinary lengths to save his family from peril. Director and co-writer Mel Gibson has made a career of heroic men who emerge from mundane circumstances to combat threats to loved ones, first as an actor, now as a director. Having told this story in Medieval Scotland, apocalyptic Down Under, and present-day Los Angeles, Gibson places his classic hero on a new canvas: Mayan civilization circa 1500. For those who crave action, primitive weaponry and hand-to-hand combat prove as compelling as explosions and machine guns. As gruesome violence is also a Gibson tradition, there is plenty of that too.<br /><br />In the jungle of early 16th century Central America, tribespeople go about their daily business. Young men hunt and make jokes, elders dole out advice and stories, and families enjoy one another's company. The idyll is shattered one morning when a group of Holcane warriors raid the village, burn it to the ground, take prisoners, and kill almost indiscriminately. A young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) manages to conceal his pregnant wife (Dalia Hernandez) and son in a nearby pit before he is captured. He and his fellow captives are marched through jungle, river, and hills until they reach a city. The Mayans are a civilization in crisis, plagued by disease, crop failure, and famine.  Desperate to appease their gods, they have gruesome plans for the prisoners. But Jaguar Paw is determined to return to his forest and his family, who need his help to get out of the pit.<br /><br />The pregnant woman in peril and the relentless young husband are cliches. And it's hokey for a person named Jaguar Paw to be saved by a jaguar, which he happens to run into up a tree. But this is an environment we're not used to seeing, and "Apocalypto" effectively builds suspense in spite of its predictability. The only time it ran out of steam for me was during the jungle chase, which resembles "The Perils of Pauline" after a while. What most impressed me about "Apocalypto" is the meticulously recreated Mayan aesthetic. The piercings, tattoos, and scarifications can be off-putting, and that's before we arrive in the city, where the wealthy proudly display jade-inlaid teeth and huge headdresses. But it grew on me. After a while, I caught on to this concept of beauty, and it became glamorous and alluring.<br /><br />Much has been made of historical inaccuracies in this film, but I don't think its sins are so grievous. Elements from Mayan classic and post-classic periods are combined for aesthetic reasons, and fictions such as the human target game and, I assume, the tapir trap are added to enhance the action and showcase Mayan weaponry. That kind of thing will drive a historian nuts, but laypeople shrug it off. Although Jaguar Paw is imbued with modern, middle-class values, and the film's thematic framing device, "a great civilization in not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within", necessitates muddling of dates, this seems to me a good introduction to Mayan civilization -largely because we get to see what these people looked like, with the help of a recreated city and 700 extras. All dialogue in "Apocalypto" is Yucatec Maya, which is not the actors' native language. English subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Touchstone 2007): There is a making-of documentary, one deleted scene (30 sec), and an audio commentary. "Becoming Mayan: Creating Apocalypto" (25 min) interviews Mel Gibson and co-writer Farhad Safinia about locations in Mexico and building the Mayan city. Other members of the creative team talk about recreating the Mayans through costumes and make-up. Weapons consultant Simon Atherton discusses Mayan weaponry. The audio commentary is by writer/director/ producer Mel Gibson and co-writer/co-producer Farhad Safinia. This casual commentary doesn't have as much historical information as I would have liked. But it does provide some Mayan background, as well as discussions of lighting, the intentions behind some scenes, and filming anecdotes. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, English, Spanish, and French.
Long before Vietnam there was unrest in the jungles far across the Pacific Ocean in what we now call Central America. But don't expect a History lesson here, folks. Do expect an action movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Apocolypto is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish, and not a word of English is spoken throughout. There are subtitles, but I don't think that there is a scene in the movie where you wouldn't be able to figure out what was going on if there were no subtitles at all.<br /><br />Apocolypto tells the story of the approximate 48 hour period of when one Maya tribe clashes with another, and focuses on the effects of the clash on tribe-member Jaguar Paw and his family. The movie hits on all emotions, and is brutally violent at times.<br /><br />The key to viewing Apocolypto is to remember that the idea here was not, as I said earlier, to give the viewer a History lesson. The film takes a fictional, isolated, 2-day period out of Maya civilization and makes an awesome movie out of it. So the critics who were screaming "historical inaccuracies" and "racism" need to relax.<br /><br />At the time of the film's release there were some negative reviews that said Apocolypto portrayed native Mesoamericans as savages, but never covered and explained the achievements by the Maya culture in art, architecture, language, math and astronomy. Well, no, Apocolypto indeed does not really cover that stuff in detail....It's an action movie, not a documentary!<br /><br />Writer/producer Farhad Safinia (who met Gibson while working on The Passion <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHJQ">The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition)</a> ) said in a Reuters article from December 2006 that the idea of Apocolypto was "to update the chase genre by not updating it with technology or machinery but stripping it down to its most intense form, which is a man running for his life." And that is what you get....Apocolypto is a kind-of Maya civilization First Blood <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a> (1982) story that takes place in the jungles of the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula circa 1517.<br /><br />Welcome to the jungle. No one can outrun their destiny.<br /><br />Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but he now has under his direction 3 of the best movies ever made (Apocolypto, Braveheart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95">Braveheart</a> [1995] and The Passion [2004]). Apocolypto is one for the collection and should be added to your cart. If you dropped support of Gibson because of his recent public controversy, I can certainly respect that; I therefore suggest that you not miss Apocolypto when it hits cable.
I realize that Mel Gibson is quite the flake, but how can anybody deny that this is an amazing film that should have been nominated for at least a few Oscars. The Costumes, the make-up, the art direction, the cinemaphotography, and the director all did quite an amzing job with this film. The Acting is also verry impressive...all in all, this was an amzing movie..and anything amazing deserves such recognition. Unlike movies like "The Queen" that were just average (excluding Helen Miran's better than average performance). Apocalypto was truly great! Certainly better than many of the movies that got nominated at the Academy Awards.
As already mentioned, Apocalypto's story is one that has been told countless times; good guy minding his own business, bad guys come and start trouble, good guy battles enormous odds to survive and protect his family. But what is new is that the setting is the jungles of the 16th century Mayan civilization where the consequences of your submission to the bad guys might very well end up with you becoming a human sacrifice. The Mayan world that Mel Gibson depicts is a scary one indeed.<br /><br />As with all movies, there are apparently some "historical inaccuracies" in 'Apocalypto' but from what I gather they are relatively minor. This is essentially what Mayan civilization was like. The costume and set design was phenomenal, the action was practically non-stop, and the acting was all-around fantastic. Yes it is violent, but surely not the most violent movie ever or any such thing. My only real complaint was the ending. While not bad, I was expecting something a little bit more climactic. All in all, this is a solid film that brings to life a rarely covered period of history.
Mel Gibson is the ultimate visionary in movie making. He has easily eclipsed his peers. BRAVEHEART - PASSION OF THE CHRIST - APOCALYPTO. On APOCALYPTO, his third milestone masterpiece, Gibson creates a most stunning, provocative portrait of what his instincts and genius gift of vision bring to reality in present tense what most likely is an accurate picture of the lost Mayan civilization in the jungles hundreds of years past. Other than what the Middle Ages explorers, conquerors and settlers wrote of the New World in their detailed journals for future generations to learn, we may never know what and how the Mayan world truly looked during the time set in APOCALYPTO, but, Gibson's visual recreation appears an exact and precise wonder to behold, and almost just as great as being there to witness a bit of the time and events depicted. Gibson's devotion to the most intimate, minute details of recreating a world he and his audience never lived in are mind boggling and never fail to touch on all aspects of the human condition and emotion. Mel Gibson is not only a visual perfectionist, he also maintains the integrety of the native dialects or spoken language of the times in his master epics. His films inspire and speak volumes for themselves upon viewing. Gibson captures our imagination through his blunt, realistic bird's eye view of whatever subject haunts him to research and bring to the silver screen for his devoted audience to behold. We are so enraptured in his art that we can't help but follow with fascination. He could easily create another incredible epic of universal acclaim if he decides to produce the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Civilization in one of his future cinematic endeavors. Mel Gibson was only warming up, observing, learning and absorbing during his era of role playing in front of the camera through the first phase of his film career. He will continue to amaze us with his wondrous epics of sights and sounds for the remainder of his illustrious and spectacular career, whether in front, or behind the camera.
i can not change any minds about this movie, but it is absolutly one of the best movies ever created
Apocalypto takes us back to the Americas right before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1492.  The film sheds light on the exotic Mayan civilization as it brings to the screen the tale of a young man captured during a raid, who tries to escape from his captors in order to get home where he has left his wife and child helpless and vulnerable.<br />The movie follows a pragmatic and realistic account of life in the Americas in the 15th Century.  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jaguar Paw, and his quest of returning home to save his family, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), the deteriorating conditions (civil war, decadence, disease, drought, corruption) which led to the decline of the Mayan civilization and its eventual demise at the hands of the Spanish Conquistadors.<br />The cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br />The setting (!), the dialogues, the language (!), the music, and the costumes are all wonderful!<br />Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will definitely provide for an evening's entertainment.<br />In short, Apocalypto is a film you should seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!
This is a gruesome movie about a man and his fight to survive and save his family.  It is extremely brutal, but is also powerful and stirring.  The first half starts a little slow, but once it starts, it doesn't let up.  One the best movies I've seen. Ever.
If there is one good thing to be said about Mel Gibson; its that he associates himself with very unique movies that are usually quite good.  Breaveheart was probably the first big movie that looked at English colonialism in Europe.  Likewise this movie, which he purportedly funded himself, is probably the biggest movie out there about the experience of Native Americans prior to the arrival of Europeans.  The "native" characters are played entirely by actors and actresses of Native American descent.  And they speak the correct native language for that time and place; Quecha.  Set right before the arrival of the Spaniards, the movie also shows the complex world of Central American societies at that time, such as the religious beliefs, social organization, and accomplished skills in construction and architecture; all done without metal tools or parts!  Like other Gibson movies, there is an abundance of inter-personal violence, most of it quite realistic and bloody.  Underlying this visual spectacle are story themes rehashed from hundreds of other movies.  These include the trials of the main protagonist, who, though injured, outlasts and kills of most of a hunting party chasing him down.  This latter chase scene is quite reminiscent of many Rambo movies.  Of course he does this to save his pregnant wife and son; which is a storyline found over and over again, including in a previous Gibson flick; The Patriot.  Overall, this movie is quite good; it puts the audience in a world few of us will ever think of, let alone heard of.  The special effects are top notch, as are the action scenes.  The story-line however, is something to be improved upon.
I know, many will disagree, since many of the depicted scenes are questionable, and possibly lack authentic elements. What makes this movie great is that it has poetic elegance. Also, several scenarios carry universal human appeal. I was going to give it a five star; I gave four star instead, due to the use of a bit too much coincidences. But history is always full of lucky coincidences--hind sight always says so. Good show, brings you closer to your animal self.
Note that there quite well may be some spoilers in this review.  If you do not want spoilers...do not read this review.<br /><br />I've watched this movie; as a matter of fact, I have watched it three times.  I find it riveting for some reason.  The story here at first glance is quite simple.  A peaceful group (A tribe really) living in the jungle is attacked by a group of Mayan warriors.  Their village is destroyed.  Most of the people are brutally slaughtered.  A group of men and women are taken prisoner and led off to (as the story unfolds) an unknown region.  When they arrive at the Mayan city some of the captives are sold into slavery while others, all male, are sent to be sacrificed to the Mayan Gods.  Grim and gruesome stuff here folks!<br /><br />One of these men who is to have his heart ripped out and head cut off escapes at the last minute.  The remainder of the story consists of this young man running from a group of warriors through the jungle, who are trying to kill him as he tries to return to the site of his destroyed village and save his pregnant wife and young son who have hidden in a deep well from which there is no escape without help - most certain death.<br /><br />As I watched this film I could not help but remember one of my favorite movies from 1966 - "The Naked Prey,' with Cornel Wilde playing the lead.  This was a different story line, different country, different time and different circumstances, but still and all these two films shared much in common and both have their origins with the true story of John Colter's legendary escape from the Blackfoot Indians in the 1800s.  There is much drama and action in all three of these tales; both the true stories and the fictional.<br /><br />Now potential viewers should take note.  The movie being reviewed here is most certainly not for the squeamish.  The violence is brutal, heartless and above all, graphic and there is a lot of it.  Death in this movie is not painful and the film leaves very little to the imagination.  Being hacked apart with stone weapons is not a pretty sight.  I will say though (and this is strictly my own opinion) that the violence is not gratuitous.  No, the entire movie is based of violence and without it the story simply could not be told and the overall effect would be completely lost.  If you are offended by such, then you probably need to make another entertainment choice.  The graphic violence and action is almost nonstop throughout this film.<br /><br />I not via reading these reviews, both there and on other sites and through conversations with friends that there are some objections to this film, the primary one being that it is not "historically accurate."  I am neither an expert on the Mayan civilization nor an expert as to this particular era.  On the other hand, I have a lot of general information.  First, I do not feel that the maker of this film (Gibson...more about that later), was trying to make a documentary or academic work of any sort.  This is an action/adventure film...simple as that.  I do know (From what little I do know) that the look and feel of the entire film "felt right."  With the exception of the time line involved here, I should think that no one really truly knows for sure all the historical facts concerning this particular civilization.  After all, the Europeans more or less destroyed as much of the civilization as they possibly could, which included any written records.  Much of what we know of the Mayan Civilization is records kept by Europeans (for the most part Priests) and from what I can tell many of the accounts handed down to us are questionable at best.  No, if you want a documentary then you had best watch the History Channel, Discovery Channel or better yet, read a good book.  I would also like to know if anyone has every seen a film based on historical facts that Hollywood  did not fiddle with.  If such a film exists, I certainly have not seen it.<br /><br />The second biggest objection as to this film seems to be that Mel Gibson made it.  Mel Gibson is not a very popular guy right now due to some very poor and misguided life choices he has made recently.  Included in this criticism of Gibson, are critical comments that Gibson was somehow trying to make a religions statement in having the Spanish ships show up at the very last and of course carrying a cross, there by symbolizing that the "Christians are coming, the Christians are coming" and all will be well.  I for one did not get this impression at all.  Perhaps I am missing something?  I do know (an it is pretty much historical fact here) that the brutality displayed by the Mayan was only a wee bit less than the brutality displayed by the Europeans as they pretty well conquered two continents over the next couple hundred years.  If this was Gibson's intention (and I doubt if it was), then he missed a big hunk of his history lessons while growing up.<br /><br />I more or less ignored the fact that Gibson made the movie as I am not all that pleased with him myself at this time. (Hey, I think Shawn Penn is an absolute twerp but have to admit the little guy can act and makes good movies.)<br /><br />I was fascinated with the photography in this film...it is some of the best I have seen for this particular genre.  The action was swift and never ending.  The story was believable (Yes, there were instances where the viewer's credulity may be stretched just a bit - but most action adventure movies do this when you really thing about it).  I liked the fact that the entire movie's dialog was done is subtitles - this lent realism.<br /><br />I am entertained while watching this movie and while my standards for entertainment may not be that of others, still and all, this movie worked for me and to be honest, the only reason I set through movies is to be entertained.  I will be the first to admit though; this movie will not be for everyone...most certainly not!<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks
If someone more politically correct did this film they would have been nominated for best director and best picture. This film is simply haunting and breath taking. It's gory too, but the sacrificial scene to me was the most captivating of all, because near the end of Tikal this is how sacrifices played out, and to see it brought life on screen was jaw dropping.
I don't care what people write/say about Mel Gibson - he makes great movies. This being one of them. I saw it at an IMAX. Man-o-man. It was great. I eventually got this as a gift. I can watch this movie over and over. The subtitles are perfectly done. They are on just long enough to read. Plus their is not alot of extended dialog. I am really surprised this movie didn't win more awards then just one (actually I am not, considering Hollywoods disdain for Gibson). It is an amazing video with a great script, dialogue, music and video. A real keeper.
This is the most innovative movie I have seen in 20 years - it is a first person of life in a primitive society.  How often have you seen narrative  without the noble native fable.  Hollywood will hate this because they have no new ideas and it is politically incorrect and they generally hate Mel Gibson.
The Movie:<br /><br />For some reason, I felt like Mel Gibson was trying to show us our current state of affair in this move in a subliminal manner. The scene in the big city, people and rules reminded me our current state of operation in our country. Those who know and those who do not know while continue to be manipulated by knowledge owners. Good catch Mel...<br /><br />I know Mel Gibson missed the Academy Award on this piece, simply he got drunk and said things he should not have. But, the movie should not have been punished. A film is a team work, result of hundreds of artists contributing to every second of it. That is why Academy of MP is piece of crap..Voting based on politics solely, not art..I am awarding the best movie of the year to this film.... Period...<br /><br />The scenes are simply breath taking, actors are well chosen and acted.<br /><br />Media:<br /><br />Originally, I watched this on a theater screen, but the Blu-ray I received is showing the film in adjusted cine-action mode, making the film look like day time soap opera. And, I know my TV setting is off for motion enhancement. I never use it. Something about the way the movie as transferred to Blu-Ray. Not a big deal. I think, because the scenes are so fast pace that perhaps, producers wanted to minimize the pixelation issues by using motion enhancement on Blu-Ray<br /><br />VERDICT: BUY IT !<br /><br />(Thanks for reading my review...)
With the 2012 meme hot on the minds of alternative archeologists, occultists, religious fanatics, and the rest of us crazy people, the Mayan civilization has started its steep upward climb back into the minds of modern civilizations. Mel Gibson - fresh off of his Passion of the Christ work, in which he laughed at traditional movie distribution all the way to the bank - decided to try his hand at the ancient civilization equation with his Mayan epic Apocalypto.<br /><br />As the title suggests, this is a story about the beginning of the end of the Mayan civilization, as told through the narrative of Jaguar Paw. His village invaded, and his people captured, Jaguar Paw is trekked across the Mexican jungle to a great Mayan city to be sacrificed. His only goal: surviving to get back to his wife, whom he left down a shallow cavern to save her.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw's ordeal is your traditional action/adventure, but his story allows Mel Gibson to give viewers a glimpse into the world of the declining Mayan civilization during a time of an immense drought, wanning resources, and resulting in a large number of human sacrifices.<br /><br />The movie, for the most part, is historically accurate, with some liberties taken to enhance the awe of the spectacle. Many people have complained about the movie being inherently racist with its portrayal of the Mayan's as bloodthirsty savages; and though I will admit that the scientific and mathematical accomplishments of the Maya were glossed over in favor of the human sacrifice, we do know that a great deal of human sacrifice did occur during the Mayan decline. Gibson may have portrayed the Maya as overtly savage, but the scenes between Zero Wolf and his son showed compassion, and the city scenes showed a complex society built on more than just bloodshed.<br /><br />Another complaint that a few had, was that they felt Gibson was portraying the conquistadores at the end as the "saviors with crosses" of these savage people. I disagree. If this were the case, then Jaguar Paw would have been "saved" by the them. Instead, he returns to his wife and seeks a "new beginning" deeper into the forest, away from the Spanish.<br /><br />The DVD contains a nice documentary about the making of the film. Particularly interesting is the making of the city and costumes. The deleted scenes - or should I say scene - only contains one brief moment where an injured deer passes by.<br /><br />The film itself is phenomenally entertaining and anyone caught up in the 2012 meme - or anyone who's an ancient cultures buff - would do themselves a good deed by sitting down and watching it.
To be blunt, I'm NO fan of Mel Gibson the person. However, I put that aside and saw this film - I was amazed. The visually stunning scenes of the Mayan city were incredible.<br /><br />Yes, this film has some violence. But try to get past it and just enjoy the film. It's an incredible story and is beautifully filmed.<br /><br />The soundtrack is haunting and beautiful.<br /><br />The "making of" feature is a bore but the film itself is a good one.<br /><br />I was blown away by this film. Hope you enjoy it too if you check it out.
Having seen the movie Apocalypto soon after being released.  It created a interest in the history of the Myan people.  I since have visited two Myan ruins in the last few years, the last being Tulum.  I knew then, I wanted to watch this movie again.
Apocalypto is an intensely exciting film, full of surprises and dashing-through-the-jungle-chased-by-terrifying-people thrills. The frightening thing is (was) that the ancient Mayans were a civilized people with advanced architecture and social structures - but they also had a religion which demanded human sacrifice. It's all in here, and packaged in a genuinely heartrate-increasing style. Well done, Mel!
This is a masterfully created film. The images are exquisite the acting is fantastic and the storyline is powerful. No director can hope to create a better film. If we could currently get other films as good and as well made as this one we would truly be experiencing a new Golden Age of film. Since we aren't films like Apocalypto shine even brighter. The set pieces created for this film are exceptional. This is a masterpiece of a movie.
I saw this movie once and have been trying to find it every since.  I will buy it for my collection.<br /><br />The story line was great.  It kept me on the end of my seat.  Beautiful scenes and detail.  Even some humor.  You really want to help the hero make it.
The quality of this film on Blu-Ray is amazing.  The colors of the jungle come to life in 1080P.  This movie is one of my favorites, an action adventure underdog overcomes all story.  The mayan cultural references intrigues me as well.  I would recommend this movie, especially in Blu-Ray for anyone on the edge.
I am not going to get to deep into the story. There are a 1000 reviews here and they are extremely positive. Those that aren't focus on the historical innaccuracies. Let's be honest here...if you want to watch a historical documentary...please turn to the HISTORY CHANNEL! Otherwise, this is an adventure set 600 years towards the end of the Mayan civilization. The main character is a young man named Jaguar Paw. He is a fierce hunter, loving husband and father whose world is destroyed when his  village is attacked by Mayans. Before his capture, he hides his wife and son in a well. Against all odds he must flee his captors and return to his family before the rains come! What ensues is nothing short of an adrenaline rush! A great movie!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: One word: WOW! This is gorgeous! The colors explode and fill the screen! Lush green jungles, roaring fires, and solar eclipses! This is a visual joy! DEMO DISC! The audio is outstanding as well. All special features from the DVD are carried over. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE! A MUST OWN!
Mel Gibson tells a good story in a great way.  Beautiful settings, great performances.  A travel back in time.
Another great foreign film by Mel.  Like the Passion, the English subtitles are not that distracting.  Rather, I think they add to the authentic feeling of the picture. It's an entertainment picture, not a documentary.  So ignore the negative critics commenting about the accuracy of the film.
Yes it is bloody but it is true to life for the time it is portraying. The beginning of the film had me rolling on the floor with laughter. I can imagine Mel directing this spot. The actors must have had a ball! It is the only "subtitled" move I have ever watch all the way thru, and I own it so I have watched it several times. It is well worth watching and owning. CONGRATS TO MEL ON A FINE JOB!!
After all the comments about historical inaccuracies, I have but one question: Why didn't they just make this movie about Aztecs instead of Mayans?  We all know that Cortez, Montezuma and human sacrifice were contemporary to one another, so why didn't they just use Aztecs?<br /><br />History stuff aside (and I don't know much about this here period, mis amigos), this movie is great.  Lots of action and costumes, great sets and cinematography, fabulous story.  What's not to like?  An enjoyable ride.  Quite unlike any movie I've seen.  Definitely worth a look.
Mel Gibson has done an excellent job presenting a very disturbing subject.  The narrated directors cut is a must.
Apocalypto<br />Before I start this review I'd like to say that I am not a history major. I am not going to analyze this film for its inaccuracies like many other reviewers. I am just going to review this movie for what it is...a movie.<br /><br />Mel Gibson is at it yet again. With the success of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HBKC">The Passion of the Christ</a>, Mel can pretty much do anything he wants now. This movie takes place in the early 1500s when Mayans were still a dominant force. The Mayans would conquer villages and tear down miles of forestry just in build their cities. They would sacrifice lives just to increase their empire. Speaking of sacrifice, you will see a ton of that in this movie. The Mayans worshipped Gods that were appeased by sacrifice.<br /><br />When I first watched through this movie I was a little disappointed. I had heard so many great things about it and felt that the movie was lacking. I was considering giving it three stars. Then I watched it with Alternate Commentary by Mel Gibson and Farhad Safinia as well as the Making of extra. These changed the way I thought about the movie. If anyone feels let down by the movie, these extras will help you much better understand the movie and appreciate it.<br /><br />Your main character is Jaguar Paw. He is a part of a small village of hunters. The movie starts of with a very humorous sequence that shows Jaguar and a few others playing a joke on another tribesman. This truly established that these were fun loving, normal people. I'm glad they introduced the film this way. Soon after their village is attacked by the Mayans. Some of them are killed, but most are taken as slaves. Jaguar luckily lowered his pregnant wife and child into a pit to hide before he was captured.<br /><br />After that point you will see them walk all the way to the Mayan capital. This is fairly long and has its moments, but I felt it was fairly boring. When they get to the place a sacrifice is where things really start to pick up. Jaguar doesn't get sacrificed, but instead is used as Target Practice by the Mayan soldiers. Suddenly, he escapes, but not with out killing the chief's son first. This sets up a huge chase scene with a ton of great moments. Jaguar must get his wife and child out of the pit before they drown from the rain filling it up. The ending to the movie is a surprise and if you know your history is very interesting.<br /><br />My problem with the film is that the gore is not what I expected it to me. Most of it is good, but part where they are tearing organs just looks unrealistic. Mel Gibson tried so hard to make sure that the 800-member cast looked perfect, but added in people ripping out organs that took me out of the film. Also, Jaguar Paw is one of the most uninteresting characters in the movie and he is your main character. He garners no emotion at all.<br /><br />Overall I would say that this is a pretty good movie. Some people my find it difficult to read subtitles constantly, due to the movie being in the Mayan language, but it's not that bad. Also, I'm really happy that they gave us subtitles for the alternate commentary. My girlfriend is partially deaf, so it is very helpful for us.
This is a story of true Mayan warriors, who battled all odds to protect and save, what was most prescious to them (Family). Two people stood against what seemed like insurmountable odds & won. Jaguar Paw (lead character) was a most dynamic character but it was his wife 9 months pregnant, giving birth under water, which took the cake;this feat was accomplished in a quickly flooding well, while she balanced her 3 year old son on her shoulders. This took place while she was standing on a rock ledge no more than a few inches wide. Prior to this event Jaguar Paw's wife fended off a wild animal, striking it 3 times, before it finally died. There wasn't any of the usual panic you see in other movie depictions of a heroine in distress.<br /><br />Apocalypto illustrates the true nature of a warrior opposed to a soldier. This is the true warrior nature in all of humanity. What did Jaguar Paw say at the very end (let's go into the forrest and make a new beginning),deservingly so. Had they gone to greet the interlopers they would have been enslaved once again. Mel Gibson brought a little diversity into mainstream cinema, so I give it a five. It's much better than the passion of Christ. Now we need another based on the 2012 Mayan prediction!
It's worth buying, good flick. I've read alot of books about the Maya, nice to see some of it on my TV. The ending isnt right, with the Spanish coming over at that time, but... its still a good movie. Go visit the Yucatan and see the ruins, its amazing to stand there.
Many reviewers spoke of the movie itself, which was incredibly well done and held your interest from start to finish. I wanted to comment on the blu-ray version of the film. Visually, it was brilliant, sharp, clear, with breath-taking scenes in the jungles and the Mayan cities. Images were stunningly beautiful. Audio was equally impressive, and I was using a mere 5.1 channel surround sound system. I can't imagine the sound through a true HD audio receiver. Overall, a wonderfully done movie, but as violent as violent can get.
As with any subject of history, it tells better if it mixed with fiction.<br />This a fiction with a lot of "real" history behind it.
This film was absolutely wonderful, I was glued to the screen, I enjoyed the work so much I purchased the DVD and have watched it 2 more times! I have always enjoyed history - specifically the Americas.  The Mayan culture still fascinates me as do the Aztec and North American tribes.  This movie makes me feel I am living in the time depicted and observing all that occurs.  Violence does not bother me as long as it is not gratuitous, this film is somewhat violent but I felt that the violence shown was appropriate given the subject matter.  The location was beautiful and felt very real!  I just really like this film - notwithstanding the problems Mel Gibson ran into shortly before the release. Do yourself a favor and at least rent the DVD and let yourself go!
Mel Gibson ( who is the best Hollywood has to offer) scores an impressive hit in this first class thriller!<br /><br />A great deal has been written about the historical accuracy of the film.<br />It is true that the Mayans built such "temples", and it is true that human sacrifice was practiced. This much is certain.  Other elements of the film are extrapolations, educated guesses, and ways to carry the story line along. That's fair enough, as written, documented history of the Mayans is sometimes sketchy, at best.<br /><br />Kudos, Mel , on a great film!
Apocalypto is a great film that grans you by the throat right from the off and doesn't let go until the end. I found the film absolutely flew by as I was gripped by the tension and some of the horrific violence.<br />Normally I cant stand subtitled films but this one didn't require much dialogue so it didn't matter.<br />Excellent.
Action packed and attention grabbing endeavor from an actor I find better on the directorial side of the camera. Captivates with the activities and lifestyles of the Central American societies prior to the white man's arrival. Good insight into the decay of the Mayan empire, but not overly historical about the true reason's behind it's sudden collapse. This is a movie I watch over and over again (from time to time) and never get tired of.
I love this movie. Mel Gibson manages to recreate the world of the Ancient Mayans to such a degree of believability that it makes me anxious to see what he comes up with next. The movie is very simple in its story (it's basically a capture, escape and pursuit chase film) but is so intense that it just keeps you glued to the screen, watching and waiting to see how the next display of human brutality will top the next. And boy, is this movie violent. I don't consider it gratuitous though, simply because the times depicted in the film were just as violent, if not more so. The violence in this film gives an immediacy to the film and makes the threat more real. Make no bones about it, this movie is a rough ride but somehow manages to be uplifting at the same time.<br /><br />The DVD is presented in fantastic picture quality and the DTS 5.1 mix is absolutely fantastic as well, filling the room with the lush sounds of the jungle from every direction. My only wish is that the DVD had a more concise making-of feature but all that is presented here is a rather short featurette that touches on several facets of the production but not in as much detail as I would've liked. It's okay to watch but I think a nice two hour documentary (at least two!) would've been a great way to detail what was obviously a lot of hard work and research on the part of the filmmakers. There is also a commentary by Gibson and the co-screenwriter of the film which is informative and rife with Gibson's kooky humor.<br /><br />This is a great film which is very simple but still a stunning visual treat and human drama that I really enjoyed. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who can't stand the sight of blood in a film but I'd recommend it to anyone else who thinks they can handle it.
Forget what you think about Mel Gibson as a person, because either way this guy can make a movie.  The controversial "Apocalypto" is a film like no other, telling a compeling story of survival amidst extinction, using suspense and thrills that sends chills down the spine while being on the edge of your seat.  This was not the film I was expecting to see, but came away from it with a sense of power and strength, and the emotions of the will to survive.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes basically sets the Mayan village setting for us, with moments of humor (good humor at that), bonding, and family.  The dialouge is actually subtitled in English, which really is fitting for this movie.  Some of the cinematography gives you the feel of being in a Mayan jungle, and their language adds to the realism.  Once things get rolling - thus begins the roller coaster that never stops, as the Aztec (supposedly Aztec, but not necessarily) warriors make their move and all hell breaks loose, almost literally.  Powerful scenes of violence and cruelty continue constently, again adding to the realism and sickness of such an event - specifically the Aztec way of life.  The main charcatcer "Jaguar Paw" played by an impressive Rudy Youngblood, is captured (along with most of the rest of the villagers) by the Aztecs and leaves behind his pregnant wife and young son, though keeping them secretly in a safe location.  For the reminader of the movie, you know he has to get back to them and rescue them, promising them he would return.  But how can he possibly escape the fate that seems to be set in store for him and the villagers?<br /><br />The story actually is not as complex as I imagined it would have been.  This movie is basically a thriller/suspense, and doing whatever it takes to stay alive.  The only depth I really found was when a young girl speaks of a sort of prophecy.  No one wants to believe her, but the events begin coming true.  There is a good deal of insight into what life might have been like, and the sets and imagery used for the Aztec culture is shocking to an extent.  There seemed to be lots of detail, so that every aspect of this culture could be recognized.  Though its a shame to see what it represents, the great Aztec city is truly a spectacular sight, and Mel did just a fantastic job mkaing it come alive on film.<br /><br />Among the controvery associated with this film, its probably the amount of gore and violence that have people talking about the most.  From the beginning of this film to the end, you will find plenty of very disturbing scenes.  Its not really ment for entertainment purposes like a horror movie, but to give a more sense of realism.  Some scenes that really get gruesome is the eating of animal balls, hearts being torn out of bodies, beheadings, and squirting blood from a head.<br /><br />This film could also be considered action, though I wouldn't call it fun action at all.  Nevertheless, there are lots of fights and a ton of chases through the jungle.  The camera work is very impressive with these chases, with little to no shaking occuring.<br /><br />The charcaters are all convincing in this film.  The actors and actresses were chosen wisely.  Rudy Youngblood does a find job as the lead, but its the Aztec leaders that sell it the most.  Two very convincing and downright dirty villains are created, both of whom send a good dose of fear to the viewer.<br /><br />If you can deal with some disturbing scenes and lots of gore, this is a movie that everyone should see.  A great look into what might have very well been for these cultures.  It is very powerful and moving, and this movie is one you will never forget after watching.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Charcaters - 5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4.5
Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" is the tale of a protagonist (Jaguar Paw) caught up in the epic and often tragic tale of civilization.  It is a story of courage, love, cruelty, and honor.  The film is set in sixteenth century Mexico.  The Mayan civilization is centuries past its heyday and on the verge of its destruction.<br />The protagonist is living in a peaceful native village with generally likeable inhabitants.  Things change quickly in a fairly disturbing scene where Mayan warriors slaughter or enslave most of the inhabitants.  What fallows is a journey to a still grand but declining Mayan city and a lone journey to save his family.  The Mayan civilization seems so foreign and yet so familiar to the modern world.<br />Although shot in an ancient language, the subtitles and story are easy to follow.  The film has many memorable and haunting scenes including the attack on the village, the diseased girl predicting the fall of the Mayas, and the protagonist stumbling into a field of bodies reminisent of a Khmer Rouge killing field.  The chase sequence is well executed with such dangers as pursuing warriors, waterfalls, quicksand, and Jaguars.  The scene on the rainy beach toward the end was effectively shot.  Due to graphic violence and some nudity, this is not a movie for children.<br />Overall, a beautifully filmed and at times disturbing image of the individual and civilization as a whole.
I rented this on blu-ray from Netflix.<br />The movie is incredible in HD.  It's the best told naked people in the jungle movie I have ever seen.<br />Bonus points for the seductive natives.<br /><br />My one complaint is the ending.  I would have liked to find out what happened to the civilization portrayed in the film.<br />I guess we will never know.
"Apocalypto" is an easier movie to admire than it is to love.  Mel Gibson utilizes all the tricks of his trade to make an intelligent, thoughtful movie and yet what sticks with you is the over-the-top, unrelenting violence of the film.<br /><br />Set in the 16th century, "Apocalypto" focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization, one of the most fascinating yet ignored cultures in the Western hemisphere.  Jaguar Paw is a young warrior in a jungle tribe of Maya, father to a young boy and waiting for his pregnant wife to bring another son into the world.  The first half-hour of the film focuses on the daily life of Jaguar Paw's tribe, including a realistic tapir hunt and some hilarious scenes from the tribe's daily life.  One of the most refreshing aspects of "Apocalypto" is the movie's willingness to humanize the members of this largely-forgotten culture.<br /><br />The peaceful idyll of the tribe's life comes crashing down after warriors invade the peaceful village looking for slaves.  Men are either killed or taken prisoner, women are raped and then either murdered or taken prisoner, and children are abandoned to their fate.  Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and young son in a nearby pit, but their lifeline is cut by one of the invaders.  As Jaguar Paw and his fellow villagers are marched away in bondage, he vows to return and save his small family.<br /><br />What ensues is a slow march to hell.  The slavers trek through jungle, across mountains, ford mighty rivers, and eventually end up at a massive Mayan city.  Gibson and his team create a nightmare city of wondrous architecture build on the blood of slaves.  This is not the "Gone With the Wind" vision of slavery, with noble slaves toiling more or less willingly on gorgeous pastureland.  "Apocalypto" shows slavery in all its horrors, up close and visceral.<br /><br />For all the city's might, the Mayan city suffers.  Disease and blight plague the city, and the rulers are trying to appease their sun-god with human sacrifices . . . which is the destiny of Jaguar Paw and his friends.  Gibson and his team linger on the morbid scene that is this sacrifice - ritual disembowelment following by ripping out of the beating heart of the victim, followed by decapitation.  While this is a scene of undeniable power, feel free to keep a napkin handy for the retching that may ensue.<br /><br />A solar eclipse temporarily saves Jaguar Paw's life and provides him the opportunity to escape back to save his family.  "Apocalypto" then turns into a long chase scene as the slavers hunt Jaguar Paw.  Again, these scenes are beautiful and powerful in their way, but again the unrelenting violence becomes a bit much as the body count continues to rise in various gruesome ways.<br /><br />The climax of "Apocalypto" is complex and unsettling.  Jaguar Paw may (or may not) win out in the end, but don't look for an equivalent of Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star here.  The title of the movie is appropriate, after all.<br /><br />Gibson has made an admirable movie with "Apocalypto" that will satisfy both action fans and history buffs.  Unfortunately, the violence quotient is so high that the most likely repeat viewers of "Apocalypto" are the same folks who delight in the recent spate of torture movies, such as "Hostel" or "The Devil's Rejects."
Amazing scenes, with excelent video quality in one of the best blu-ray quality disc I've ever seen. The story don't have a proper "end", wich makes it a little frustrating...or, maybe, a second chapter.
Mel Gibson, as a filmmaker, is quite brilliant. Good actor, too. His tabloid rap means nothing to me when watching his films, as the films of Roman Polanski, Elia Kazan or Leni Riefenstahl. "Apocalypto" had me from the first frame, and I thought it was another fine film from a fine director. It's known that the Mayans had gruesome sacrificial rites, far worse than what Mr. Gibson portrayed. Still, brutal and abrasive behavior abounds regarding simple human beings who simply live to survive. Vengeance and escape are the centers of this film about a man who simply wants to go back to his family. Once he thinks everything can be happy, the Europeans arrive...and that's a whole different story. I believe Mel Gibson is an impassioned director, making film of unusual interest, and totally in command of his material. Authenticity is of utmost importance, and I commend him for this effort.
If I could give more stars, I would.  I put off seeing this movie for a long time, hearing good reviews but not being interested enough to actually view it.  When I did see it, I realized that I had been really missing out.  Besides being a visually stunning film, the pace moves at an increadible speed.  The story is brilliant, and the characters are portrayed with excellence.<br /><br />There are three "acts", if you will, or three parts that really work to move the film towards its dramatic conclusion.  Your heart is with the main characters all the way through.<br /><br />I've found a new favorite movie in "Apocalypto."  After renting it and seeing what I had missed out on, I had to immediately purchase the film.<br /><br />The only thing I would say about this movie in a cautionary way is that if you are sensitive to violence or blood, you should probably see this movie with someone who has seen it before so that they can tell you when to close your eyes.  Other than that, you can not miss this movie!
Whether or not you think this movie succeeds, rather depends on what you think Mel Gibson set out to do.  I tend to think he just wanted to make a darn good action movie, but in a setting we never see in movies - the Mayan culture.  If I am right, then he succeeded well, and warrants my 4 stars.<br />However, there is a little more in the movie that might suggest he was reaching for something more. The story is in two broad parts.  After an introduction to a bucolic life in the jungle with hunting and breeding the topics for discussion and frivolity, the movies real first part kicks off with a brutal attack on the village, and the survivors being taken away into slavery.  The only people left behind are our heroes wife and child, who remain trapped in a well unless he returns, giving our protagonist his motivation.  Thus the second part is the gruelling and cruel march to the Mayan city, which is almost like a Sodom and Gomorrah in its wickedness and depravity, the very essence of a city and culture in decay.  Our hero escapes from an apparently certain death, and the third part is a chase as he is hunted down, and he seeks to return to his family to rescue them.<br />It's all cannily put together as a whole, and also in its memorable if gory individual scenes.  The director's eye for a breathtaking shot is undeniable - I was reminded of the beauty of `The Mission' during the waterfall scene - not an unfair comparison in many ways.  The success of the movie is largely due to its script (ironically, given the subtitles) which really draws us in to the characters lives and makes us care at least a bit.  And for action, the final chase scene makes our hero something like Schwarzenegger in Predator as he uses the jungle against the city folk to great effect.<br />So a 4 or even 5 star action movie then?  Yes, but there is then that added ambiguous element - as set out in the opening quote referring to civilisation in decline, there are real similiarities, even in such an obscure scenario, to modern day.  Just enough to make you think about it if you want to, but not enough to hammer any point home.  The final few shots in particular are effective in tying up the movie in a slightly unexpected way.  In another unexpected and only lightly touched upon theme, the final third of the movie is foretold in a rather spooky scene, giving an oddly spiritual or supernatural element to an otherwise very visceral and down to earth story.<br />If he set out to make a message movie, then the movie only half succeeded - but as an action movie with the balls and cleverness to make you leave the cinema thinking?  Spot on.
Mel does it again.  Although I'm not a big fan of blood & guts nor english sub-title movies, I'll make an exception here in view of the subject matter.  This was a great movie.  Perhaps the only problem is there is just was not enough time for character development and historical perspective.  As with most movies, that's left to your imagination and your knowledge of history.  Considering the subject matter of the movie though, historical data is largely conjecture.  And character development with english sub-titles is challenging.
A visual masterpiece, stunning, gripping, I'm out of complimentary adjectives.  Blu-Ray HD just made it more immersed and lifelike. I felt as if I could reach out and touch the foliage and greenery of the forest. Great camera angles and chase scene. Loved it!
I have this movie on blue ray disk.  I have a sony hd television and played this on my playstation 3. this movie is the BOMB!  I couldn't believe how clear and crisp the picture is! the surround sound was fabulous.  We felt like we were in the movie.  the story is easy to follow.  there are subtitles, but easy to read, your not focusing on reading and missing the movie.  bloody, war scenes.  just like braveheart.  I liked it alot. Mel Gibson came through once again!  this is a movie I can watch over and over.
I watched this movie not knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised, the movie moves at a fast pace and regardless of how "Historically Accurate" the story is, it's a very good story.  Not to mention the Blu-Ray picture and Mayan PCM are phenomenal.  I rate this as a BUY.
Mel Gibson chose a bad time to reveal his true racist colors. His anti-Semitic rant destroyed any good press his new movie Apocalypto was about to receive. Not too concerned about that (art can be nobler, grander then the person who made it. That's what makes it art), I was free to judge Apocalypto on its own merits. And it delivered. I watched the DVD on a crappy little player and still felt as if I was in the sweltering jungle. The story is really simple (Jaguar Paw's village is overrun by fanatical neighbors, he must escape back to his wife and kid who are hiding out in a well, etc.), but it just gave me more time to oogle at the cinematography. And, wow. The costumes of the characters alone must have cost a fortune, and they can convey triumph, anger, fear, etc, in a completely undecipherable language. That's skill. While Apocalypto doesn't bill itself as historical (the Mayans left no written records), it provides frightening evidence of what happens when a predatory society, on the verge of extinction, decides to cannibalize itself. Watch. And tremble.
This movie was recommended to me by my sister.  I can honestly say it is one of the very best movies I've ever seen. I have loaned the dvd to several of my friends and they all raved about it.  One friend did not click something on language options apparently, and watched the entire movie without the subtitles and STILL loved it! The movie has non-stop action. You become totally engrossed and it's not easy to predict what will happen next. I like a story with some closure at the end, and this movie has that. The behind the scenes options on the menu portion are fascinating and worth watching.  The make-up and costumes are amazing and authentic according to the research done for the movie. I highly recommed this movie!!!!
I rarely give movies a 5-star rating.  I don't believe I blinked the first time I watched the movie, and I was compelled to watch it again two days later.  The movie stays with you and, while it is about the Mayans, can also be interpreted as a warning to us in the modern world.  We have not learned from history.  We are still plagued by conquest in the name of greed, and murder in the name of religion.  The movie begins with a quote from historian Will Durant: "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within." Is our world today any less barbaric than that of the Mayans?<br /><br />While my queasy female brain had trouble with the violence and torture in Braveheart, the violence here did not bother me nearly as much.  Although Apocalypto is undeniably violent,  most of it is not particularly gory, and it is not violence for the sake of cool special effects and ratings like in The Matrix or the Bond movies.  If you can watch organ dissection/removal in Grey's Anatomy while eating a bowl of pasta with red sauce, you can watch Apocalytpo.  However, if you are disturbed by portrayals of human nature at its most cruel and animalistic, then stick to Disney movies and pretend life is peachy and that we don't need to change anything or lift a finger to help the world.<br /><br />Based on the merits of this film (and not Mel Gibson's personal life and/or drunken ravings) I feel that Apocalypto was robbed of at least one Oscar win as well as the Best Director nomination.<br /><br />While Apocalypto is best suited for thoughtful movie goers, thoughtless thrill seekers should also be satisfied.
Very good action movie takes place is a amazing place and time.  Simple<br />story garnish by good production, good cinematography, good direction and<br />story-telling and breathless action and chasing scenes.  The unheard-of<br />casts and non-English speaking script make this look like a non-Hollywood<br />movie, and add its genuine sincerity .  Another winner by Mel Gibson.
This movie will knock your socks off. Brilliantly directed, visually gorgeous, great acting, incredibly bizarre, breathless pacing. You will not be able to take your eyes off it. Gibson's third film as director is easily his best and continues his theme of a heroic man who suffers for the sake of others, as seen in both BraveHeart and the Passion. This hero is a reluctant one, a simple Mayan living in a small village which is raided by other Mayans to procure human sacrifices. When I say its a story with "heart", I am not referring to the ones ripped, still beating, from the chests of the unwilling participants of this brutal rite, but that the story, altho huge in scope, centers around a family of 3. The father is motivated to overcome the greatest odds because of his love for his wife and child. I also mean "heart" in the sense of courage (a word based on the French word for heart)for the young man must face terrifying enemies and predicaments. The peril is always extreme and unrelenting.<br />Truly one of the best adventure films I have ever seen. I showed it to friends who dislike Mel Gibson and they were instantly converted to the view that, no matter what you think of Gibson, after you experience this film, you will admit that he is a masterful filmmaker. It is very violent and bloody but never gratuitous--he is faithfully portraying a violent, bloody culture and the film would be much less believable without it. It will take you to another world in another time. I only see 3 or 4 films a year that are as good as this. For a thrilling, unforgettable ride, buy or rent this masterpiece.
Mel Gibson continues to explore bravery and cruelty of humans. You can describe the story of "Apocalypto" in this way, but the fact is his latest work as director is a very engrossing adventure tale in the tradition of "The Last of the Mohicans." The difference is this adventure tale is set against the background of the last days of Mayan civilization; and as in his Oscar-winning "Braveheart," "Apocalypto" comes with lots of violence.<br /><br />The story revolves around Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), his beloved wife Seven and young son, and the villagers living peacefully in the rainforest. One day his village is attacked by the merciless soldiers sent from the plague-infected city, where the captured men and women are brought for the purpose you have already guessed. Jaguar Paw knows he must come back home before the next rain falls because his wife (who is pregnant) and child are trapped in the bottom of a dried well, and he does it no matter what it takes.<br /><br />The story itself is rather conventional, but the way it is presented is unique. All the dialogues are spoken in the Mayan language, and most of the cast are non-professionals without previous experience as actor. The cinematography is by Dean Semler ("Dances with the Wolves"), but the shooting is mostly done digitally by HD camera. But you wouldn't mind all these things once the film starts to roll and tell its story about Jaguar Paw and the warriors chasing him in the jungle.<br /><br />As to the film's content, it is true that there is violence in the film (like the execution scene of "Braveheart"), but it must be also pointed out that Mel Gibson does not make it gratuitous and excessive. Of course all these things depend on every viewer's sensitivity and certainly this film is not made for pre-teens, but Gibson avoids too direct descriptions of murders, rapes and decapitations.<br /><br />The production designs are amazing to see, but I am not sure of the historical accuracy of the customs of Mayan people or the streets and buildings of the city. I cannot judge that part. But I am sure this is an exciting, well-told adventure story that will keep you absorbed in the world unknown.
I'm not one for violence, but if it is used to help propel the story rather than as an end (to scare or gorify it), then I don't mind it so much.  Still I had to close my eyes during certian parts.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Mel puts another great movie out with a great chase scenes, action, and a story of love and a fallen society only seeking power, pleasure, and gods.  It gives you much during the movie and something to think about after the movie.
'Apocalypto' starts out with a peaceful setting.  Men from an isolated tribe are out on a hunt, bantering with each other as they track and kill their game.  One character that stands out is Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), an elder and father to young Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood).  Their peaceful, homey village is shattered early the next morning when raiders arrive, to burn, pillage, and destroy the village while taking captives.<br /><br />Young Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son down a deep sink-hole before battling and succumbing to the raiders.  Men and women alike are strapped to poles and herded through the jungle like livestock, into the vast Mayan city.  Along the way a young girl shouts out prophesies to the raiders, of a dark day and a jaguar.<br /><br />The city is truly a cinematograph wonder.  There are scenes depicting the slaves that built the Mayan pyramids, slave markets, merchants, vendors, and of course the high religious pyramid where the rulers lounge in luxury watching the sacrifices to the Gods.  Jaguar Paw escapes becoming a sacrifice by a solar eclipse.  But the Mayans still intend to make sport of him and his fellow villagers.  When Jaguar Paw manages to escape, the movie gives a chase scene not soon to be forgotten.  Jaguar Paw needs to make it back to his wife and son before the rains start, and with a pack of raiders on his tail, the going is tough.<br /><br />Many other movies are bloodier while depicting less implied violence.  The violence implied in 'Apocalypto' by the Mayan ceremonies is brutal.  There are a couple of 'dig the heart out of the chest' scenes, plus one Tarantino-Style blood spurting scene, but overall the gore was controlled in measure to the violence.  Also, many modern movies employ chase scene just as intense as Jaguar Paw's flight from the raiders, but the atmosphere of Mayan culture and the primitive weapons and fighting techniques make this chase scene unique.<br /><br />The photography is stunning, and the actors, while unknowns, are remarkable.  The entire movie is spoken in Mayan and subtitled in English (you can also choose French or Spanish), but even if you aren't fond of subtitles you should still check out the movie, the action outweighs the dialogue.  This is a visually beautiful movie with plenty of plot and action, though the plot is an old one the presentation is new.  A solid 4.5 stars.  Enjoy!
What a fantastic film if you can stomach through the violence. The movie seems to tie together a chain of human events that will forever link on into all our lives. This film made me think of human nature's desire to overcome obsticles to better our lives. We can't all end up on top, someone has to suffer so others may rise to glory.
I was excited about this movie as soon as I saw the preview for it, regardless of Mel Gibson's reputation. When I finally convinced my girlfriend to watch it with me on my birthday we were both blown away.<br /><br />This is truly the best movie I've ever seen. Perfectly made with a great story, great characterization, great customs, great music, great camera work, and a realness not found in any other film. I don't know how anyone could watch this and not feel deeply involved in the storyline. The only comparable experience I can think of is a novel.<br /><br />This movie crosses the boundaries of film as a spectator entertainment and makes it a deep emotional struggle to the end. The only other movie I can think of that even comes close to being this well done is Lord of The Rings. It blows Braveheart out of the water, that's for sure.
I had my doubts about seeing this movie because I had heard it was so bloody and violent, but after watching it, I am glad I did. Many other reviewers have described the movie, so I won't bore you with that, I'll just offer some general impressions.<br /><br />The opening scenes are designed, I think, to engage the sympathy of the viewer for the forest tribe.  While it might be difficult for many people to feel sympathy for pre-Colombian natives who are violent and even savage, I think Gibson did a good job on this part.  We accompany the men on a hunt, see that they engage in typical "male bonding" behavior, see that they have mother-in-law problems, love and cherish their children, and so on.<br /><br />More than that, during the hunting scene, we see something else: a warning given that was ignored, shoved under the rug. Had that warning of fear been heeded, preparations made to resist the impending terror, there might have been less destruction.  That's a good object lesson for us even today.<br /><br />The scenes of the Mayan city were especially helpful to me.  I have been to Mexico and have studied Mayan ruins first hand.  They left me feeling very disturbed; I could NOT imagine what kind of culture would create such savage and even ugly art.  I don't mean ugly in the sense that it was badly done, not that at all.  But the "soul" revealed in Mayan art is truly horrifying.<br /><br />Mel Gibson gave this art a background for me that finally helped me to make sense of it.<br /><br />I noticed something else: all the savagery, body pierciings, horrible and ugly hairdos of the women, and the general behavior of the culture reminded me of U.S. society over the past 10 years or so.  I know that seems a bit over-the-top, but I have never been able to understand why attractive people would go so far out of their way to make themselves ugly with hair that looks like its been cut with a dull lawnmower, body piercings, wearing clothes that look like slave gear or rejects from a concentration camp, and so on.  It's just bizarre.  (And I won't even go into what passes as art these days, much less music!)<br /><br />When you take those things in the context of what has happened to the U.S. since 9-11, and you compare it to the society depicted in this movie, there are unnerving parallels.  I even think that Gibson intended the movie to reflect the U.S. in it's decline.  At the beginning of the movie, he quotes Ariel Durant who wrote:<br /><br />"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."<br /><br />As the movie came to the end, I was glad that Gibson didn't use it as a cheesy add for his religious agenda...<br /><br />It was beautifully photographed, with fantastic sets and I have to say that the violence was not gratuitous: that's just how things were then and to have made the movie otherwise would have been cheating.<br /><br />Well worth watching; I'm glad I did.
A powerful commentary on the strength and weakness of society and religion.<br /><br />Without giving too much of the plot away, one sees a stark contrast between the beauty, parity and unity of a humble tribal village and the prejudice, oppression and fear  that rules the grandiose Mayan empire.<br /><br />As has come to be Mel style, there are layers of meaning and powerful parallel relationships that have didactic purpose (kind of like the Father and Son theme that ran throughout Braveheart). One can see the other parallels he draws between today's 'Superpowers' and their attendant ostentation, control and fear mongering.<br /><br />He manages to make concentric layers of meaning from the individual to the family the tribe and the nation and their indivisibility.<br /><br />The ending will stun you, awaken you and make you question the status quo as well as Gibson's intentions when one considers his own religious background. It made me respect Gibson as a man who can see the the broader picture of what really matters in life and faith.<br /><br />The imagery is stunning and, without knowing the historical accuracy, one is brought to a time and place without the Hollywood fanfare. Despite it's intensity Gibson manges to make you laugh as much as you cringe.<br /><br />Well worth it.
It's ironic and absolutely absurd that this film was not even nominated for directing and acting in last year's Oscar. Mel Gibson proved his super directing skill and his co-writer/co-producer did fantastic job too. I have to say that Rudy Youngblood (Jaguar Paw) and all other actors in this movie deserve an award.<br />I hated action movies before because a lot of them are just empty stories and predictable results. However this one really nailed me down. I couldn't tell what's gonna happen and almost forgot I was watching a movie, not real people. I don't think it's a racial film or down look at Maya culture. On the other hand, I was totally transformed to become a Maya culture lover.<br />The only thing I don't like about the DVD is that the special feature doesn't have ANYTHING about the cast! Not even an interview with the leading roles. UNBELIEVABLE!
This past weekend I finally watched the new Mel Gibson film: Apocalypto. This film is set in the ancient Maya civilisation just before the arrival of the first Europeans. It's graphic in it's violence and it's portrayal of the capturing of one tribe by another to be used as slaves and for ritual sacrifice is gruesome indeed.<br /><br />This movie really made me think about the link between fear and courage. This was first brought to my attention by Dr Paul Dobransky, a noted psychiatrist and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452288185">The Secret Psychology of How We Fall in Love</a>. Basically it goes like this when you are afraid you need courage to do the things that bring fear into your life. When you do courages things it fills up the amount of confidence you have to do other things which may bring feels of fear into your life. Susan Jeffers also wrote an excellent little book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345487427">Feel the Fear . . . and Do It Anyway (r)</a><br /><br />Now back to Apocalypto. This movie is set in the jungle's of Mesoamerica and right from the beginning it's very much an adrenalin rush with the capture of a wild boar. Soon after the capture the son of the tribal leader, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), through intuition or through sharp senses, gets up, turns around and calls out to what turns out to be a huge tribe in migration, to come out of hiding. This tribe is on the run from slave hunters if you can call them such. Flint Sky, the father of Jaguar Paw, reminds his son not to be afraid. He says to these tribal people moving through their forest, something like this: I am Flint Stone! This is my forest. This is my forest! My father hunted in this forest before me, and my sons will hunt here after I am gone! This is a quote that will be repeated by Jaguar Paw later on in the film.<br /><br />Soon afterwards the village of Jaguar Paw is pillaged by same slave hunters. The Mayan priests and  through them, the king, had ordained that more sacrifice is needed to purify the lands, improve the crop harvest and to save them all. The society had been in decline for a number of years. There is elements of the film that is not historically accurate but this has nothing to do with how powerful a message it conveys regarding how to overcome fear with courage. Just before he is about to be executed a solar eclipse takes place and all the ritual sacrifices is stopped. It's not over for the captures slaves as the high priest orders them killed. Through some tough determination Jaguar Paw outmanoeuvres the hunters who had captures him and manages to escape into the forest.<br /><br />And here is where he's courage is brought to the fore. His confidences increases as he gets deeper into the forest. Now just as his village was being attacked he managed to get his newly pregnant wife and son into a deep hole. And this is part of what drives him to keep going. The fact that he has to rescue them before it rains, and they drown. As the hunters close in on him he fights them off in different ways. The most exhilarating scene in the movie could be when he jumps over a waterfall. When you consider how some of the hunters following him hesitate and end up being killed because of bad jumps over the same waterfall you realise how superior Jaguar Paw's confidence has become. He is not afraid to take risks and he places himself directly in the line of fire on several occasions. With speed and agility he overcomes great obstacles in the chase. Overall though you can start to see how living in the moment, the now, brings you closer to your true self. It brings you closer to nature and your instincts can take over. Now in a modern, westernised, technologically advances society we live in there is absolutely nothing that pushes us in the same way to develop our confidence, our courage and our instincts. To a large extent we become nothing more than automatons doing repetitive things over and over. Our ability to overcome fear when confronted by it is reduces because of this group behaviour and placating activity we call living today.
Very little acting, and almost a documentary, but a fast paced action movie none the less. You've read the other reviews so probably know what it's all about by now (the film contains a little bit of everything), but understand there is a story, and the director, Mel Gibson, never loses sight of it. The theme is not original, however it's locale is, and the cinematography is superb. Only the Mayans are mentioned although I thought the film portrayed the conflict between the Mayan's, and Aztecs prior to the European invasion as the culture clash is quite evident. A little slow starting, but give it a chance. And I really like a nice ending.
If nothing else, watch this movie for its gorgeous cinematography, sets, and costumes.  The Mayan city/temple sacrifice scenes are superb.  While the gore and violence are likely no worse than any modern slasher movie they are plentiful enough.  Only unlike Freddie and his kind, the brutality in Apocalypto is probably realistic of the time the movie is set in, and it makes sense in that context.<br /><br />The movie is thought-provoking.  Maybe there's a chronological mismatch between the Mayan empire and the Spaniards' arrival, but it's intriguing to think of such a cruel people about to get their comeuppance, and how the mighty keep falling.  In real life the Spaniards had such huge success against the Aztecs precisely because of the latter's rampant savagery and tyranny against other indigenous peoples.  Like the Russians who greeted the conquering Nazis in WWII as liberators only to find them as bad as the Soviets, so will the people in Apocalypto find the Spaniards in due time.  This is foreshadowed by Jaguar Paw's (the movie's protagonist)decision at the end to not meet these strange new people but to fade into the jungle.<br /><br />There's action galore here and a rather standard plot.  Paw's pa teaches a lesson in fearlessness and then must act it out when taken prisoner.  Their bucolic jungle village, which specializes in tormenting one of its  hunters who seems unable to father a child, is overrun by a vicious Mayan brigade which takes prisoners for slavery and sacrifice.  Paw, who will have none of it because he means to save his family which he hid in a vertical cave, escapes and is hunted.  Rambo-like he manages to dispatch his followers one by one until, with determined look in his eyes, he gets revenge on the two Mayans who most had it in for him.<br /><br />But the spectacular filming and effects of this movie set it apart from the usual Hollywood ho-hum.  I think it also works having the characters speak some exotic tongue, although I wonder: is there really a Mayan dialect word for the F-Bomb?  Kids, don't repeat this Mayan word in the Yucatan.  You could get slapped.<br /><br />Wikipedia says "Apocalypto" means to discover, or reveal.  (And thus the Bible's Apocalypse.)  But exactly what was director Mel Gibson meaning to show us?  That, as he quotes Will Durant at the beginning, empires rot away before they fall away, or that there's always a tougher tyrant on the block, or that the Mayans had it all: brains, beauty, and brutality?  I'm not sure.  The movie was gruesome but also exciting and alluring in its natural and historical beauty.
Like many of you I missed the theatrical run, and not just because of Mel's bad mouth.  I had read/heard various comments about all the brutality and violence contained in this film, so I skipped it.  But the DVD beckoned to me recently at the store and I decided to trust my instincts.  Whatever kind of movie this might be, I said, it will be an honest effort by a gifted director, and I hadn't heard anyone say outright that it was a bad film.<br /><br />Other reviewers have already expressed two of my key points, so here's the bottom line:  this is a gripping, brutally honest movie about the human condition.  On one level, it looks at every person's struggle to survive in the world they're born into; on a deeper plane Gibson reminds all of us that all "great" civilizations fall into ruin.  To be precise, human beings aren't all that civilized in any century.<br /><br />Debating the historical accuracy of this type of film is pointless, because no one knows exactly how or why the Mayan empire vanished. (Global warming, perhaps?) All I know is that I'll never be able to look at those tall structures (a sort of ziggurat, reaching to heaven?) with those steep staircases which modern-day tourists struggle to climb so they can take their pictures -- without seeing the severed heads bouncing down those steps.  That's why they were built, folks, and that's all that's left of the great Mayan civilization today.<br /><br />For those of you still unclear about this:  YES, Mel is saying that all "great" human empires eventually decay from within. It happened to Egypt, Babylon, Rome, even France...and it can happen to us as well. This film throws buckets of cold water in the faces of anyone who subscribes to the "noble savage" myth -- those people were as debauched as the Romans at their worst, without the roads or nice togas.  And cruelty for its own sake remains the favorite human hobby even today.<br /><br />The action in this movie is top-notch, and the tension never lets up -- all that is true, and it's worth watching for that alone. (For those of you who used terms like "bad" or "poorly made" in your reviews, please provide the address of the alternate universe in which you reside.)  Mel's vision is a dark one, and it's scary because it's accurate.  And even if the ending isn't exactly "happy" in the traditional Hollywood sense, it's gratifying because it rings true.  In this life, a "new beginning" is the best any of us can hope for.
I don't care what you think of Mel Gibson and his personal issues but Apocolypto must be seen because this is an example of excellent film making. This movie is thrilling from beginning to end. The action is incredible and after about 10 minutes you forget that there are subtitles. The story grabs your attention from the first scene. This movie was over shadowed by the scandal that has Plagued Mr. Gibson and that is a shame because, the film making, cinematography and acting is top-notch and there is not another movie like this one. You will be thinking about it long after the credits role.
The cast as well as the hundreds of extras are absolutely convincing as Mayans.  The cinematic techniques never obscure the action but complement it, the locations, sets and costumes are impossible to take your eyes from, the story is well-paced, starting slow, building in tempo, then finally going flat-out b___s-to-the-wall.  Great directing keeps everything flowing smoothly (though I could have done without the pig-testicle eating scene in the opening), and despite a traditional story, makes the film quite a unique experience, imparting a sense of discovery as the story unfolds.  Apparently, this was wasted on some of the more sophomoric viewers who were more interested in plot comparisons to lesser "action" movies.  Sad.
Love him or loathe him, Mel Gibson can make some damn good movies. BRAVEHEART was wonderfully brutal, which Gibson produced, directed and starred in. Now fully behind the camera in his latest two feature films, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST and now APOCALYPTO, Gibson proves he's got both vision and talent (now if he could only keep his personal life out of the tabloids!)<br /><br />Because of Mel's idiotic comments of late, many have seen fit (perhaps rightfully so) to boycott his films. I know I avoided seeing this one until it came out on DVD, a mini-boycott on my part for Mr. Gibson's poor politics and social skills. But the visuals on the trailers kept beckoning me to check out Apocalypto, and so I finally broke down and rented it.<br /><br />It is noteworthy here to say that Mel, regardless of subject matter, can pull viewers into a story. Although The Passion had its anti-Jewish components, it was sumptuously filmed and very well executed. If we're here to talk about films and not the man behind the film, then it's fair to say that Apocalypto is a rousing success.<br /><br />The sets, the dress, the make-up, the incredible story, and the action, all make this film a glue-yourself-to-the-screen experience. Not once did I pull my eyes from the movie, fearing that I might miss this beautiful shot or that amazing character.<br /><br />***SPOILER WARNING***<br /><br />The story is about Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the future leader of a small band of people that live on the outskirts of the great Mayan culture. He has an ideal life, a loving wife, a tough son, and another kid "in the oven." He and his fellow townsfolk hunt the local forest for food and live in harmony with their environment. Until one day he and his tribe are ripped apart by beastly slave-gatherers. Realizing that he must hide his pregnant wife and son, Jaguar Paw lowers them into a deep pit for safe keeping during the slave runners attack. Caught, bound, and forced to march miles, Jaguar Paw and his tribesmen are brought to a great Mayan temple where they are to be sacrificed. But as Jaguar Paw's turn comes, a solar eclipse occurs and Jaguar and his remaining band are spared a barbarous beheading.<br /><br />But it ain't over yet.<br /><br />Taken to an open stadium, he and his surviving tribesfolk are told to run toward a field of corn as spears, rocks and other projectiles are hurled at them. At the end of the path, too, is a "finisher", the son of the head slave trader who kills off any of those who are wounded. Jaguar Paw, desperate to get back to his wife and child, kills the young finisher and escapes into the jungle. But the king of the slave-gatherers wants Jaguar Paw's blood for killing his son. And thus starts an adrenaline pumping chase through the thick jungle, over massive waterfalls, and deep into Jaguar Paw's country. Not only is Jaguar Paw running from the slave men, he's also running toward his beloved wife and kid in a race to save them before they either starve to death, get injured, or are drowned by flash-flood rains.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />It is amazing that none of the main actors, supporting actors, or extras have any previous film history (at least not any significant history, really), yet they all played their parts perfectly. Much praise MUST (reluctantly or not) go toward Mr. Gibson for his amazing job directing this genre-busting thrill ride. Not only is it a pseudo-historical piece, but it also has heavy elements of romance, drama, comedy, and action/adventure. Rolling all of those concepts into one film is often impossible, but Apocalypto isn't forced nor overly drawn. It completely lures you in, including the Mayan language which is spoken throughout the entire production (with English subtitles).<br /><br />The make-up consisted of nearly 70 artists who had to re-tattoo each of the 700 main and extra characters daily, a monumental task. And costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY) is to be commended for her outstanding head-dresses and eye to detail (I feel she was cheated out of an Academy Award nomination due to this film's affiliation with Mr. Gibson).<br /><br />So if you're thinking about watching this but don't like Mel Gibson personally, I totally understand. But you might try it anyway. It is one fantastic piece of cinema.
I almost missed the mesmerizing experience of viewing this captivating movie by Mel Gibson. What a dramatic and emotionally packed film this is.<br /><br />I couldn't take my eyes from it for a single second. Whomever the critics were that gave this film less than an outstanding rating could not have possibly seen the same film as I. I don't give a flip about Mel Gibson's bad press in regard to his behavior of late, and credit should be given where it is due. There is no question that it is due here. Forget all the negativity that you may have heard regarding Mel or this film. Run don't walk to your nearest store and buy this DVD, you won't regret it.
I liked the movie.<br /><br />The color, the scenery, the visual images are stunning and simply overwhelming.<br /><br />The historical accuracy and desire to be faithful to the culture and times is evident and i appreciate such expense and desire.<br /><br />The plot is both emotional stimulating and successfully accomplished-persuasively pulling me into the film and the world that it creates on screen.<br /><br />The movie is loaded with adrenalin, it nevers slows down but builds up tension and energy the whole time. Convincingly done you identify with the main character, his love for wife and family and his overwhelming desire to save them from death and destruction. You cheer at all the right parts and boo the appearance of the bad guys and desire nothing more than their just rewards. You cringe at the sense destruction of both the environment and the people for the sake of a few, you see the piles of headless corpses and see in your mind's eye those same images of concentration camps, killing fields and all the ways mankind has found to torment, degrade and finally murder our fellow beings over the generations.<br /><br />Movie making and story telling at it's best.<br /><br />a must see and probably a reviewable movie you ought to own, rich and complex enough to warrant a rewatching.<br /><br />i found nothing unsatisfying or paused to complain, but rather found ideas like the destruction of the environment and the starvation of the people, and the young girl with smallpox, ideas worth dwelling on and thinking more about.<br /><br />thanks to M.Gibson for an excellent use of all the money he made with Passion of the Christ.<br /><br />I hope he uses the justifiable profit from this money to offer us more such well done fare.
Superb and breathtaking. Let's be clear. First of all 75% of all Maya inscriptions we know have not yet been deciphered and all we have on these Indians is one thousandth of what we would need to know just a little bit about the way these Indians lived, what's more thought. The vanity of those who say some details are wrong is absurd, especially since the cinema is not a tool to tell the truth but the art of complete illusion. A false detail can only be the drop that will make the bitter-minded overflow and the straw that will break the backs of the growling grouchers. So let me not be avaricious about this film. It reaches some extraordinary magnitude and magnificence. The pictures are among the most beautiful you can imagine, be they of the forest, or of the crossing of the river, or of the waterfalls on the same river, or of the Maya city and its pyramid temples, or of the costumes of their priests, or of the gladiator games for final cynegetic execution. The action  itself is so well built that we get involved in it so intensely that we are in the body of the hunted one, without remission, without any relapse. And yet a long slow phase enables the viewer to contemplate the simple life spiritually full with tales and legends in a village in the midst of the rain forest. It is not an anthropological film, but at this level it is a film that wants to introduce us into a completely unknown setting and it succeeds marvellously, be it the physical setting or be it the spiritual and mental setting. The way Gibson uses the face expressivity of his actors, all of them amateurs though, to tell more than half of the psychological and emotional density and even passions of his characters and situations is outstanding. Some say the story is held up with pieces of strings like an eclipse that comes just when necessary. But we mustn't forget that life is only held up by such pieces of string and that simple events like a train that does not run may change the destiny of thousands of people. Life is nothing but the result of haphazard and unforeseeable whims from our environment. Some also protest against this  hollywoodian  film without telling us what it means. The film was entirely shot in Mexico exclusively using non-professional actors from an ethnic group so far never seen on the silver screen before, entirely in their language, the modern form of Maya, and entirely subtitled. These are elements that can be considered as perfectly anti-hollywoodian. If it is the spectacular show that is at stake, then many other films, like Besson's Purple Rivers, are nothing but hollywoodian films. And then what ? The most serious critics say that Mel Gibson is pondering on the fate of civilizations when they reach their final phase of self-destruction. It's both proper viewing and false understanding. It is the minimum discourse that we can see in these absurd human sacrifices to make an eclipse come and go or to palliate several years of bad crops with self mutilation, cannibal self sacrifice, suicidal self-centered morbidity. It is in a way the official method to adjust the population to the means available for survival set in some grandiose and dramatic organization of the elimination of a fringe of overpopulation. And the whole process is supposed to be bringing the most intense pleasure to the participants. We can then compare this with all the executions of human beings in humanity still practiced here and there. The death penalty aims in the same way at purifying society through some ignominous and horrifying practice, rite or crime. Long live war, preemptive or not ! But we would miss, if we stopped there, the great loop of symbolical and parabolical meaning that starts at the very beginning with the purchasing of the right to cross the forest with the exchange of three fish against one tapir leg, then the pregnant woman who must run away from killers and be saved from a flood, to finally end with the reunification of the primary family and its two sons who go back into the forest to start all over again from scratch while another ferocious band of invaders is arriving who will be just as blood-thirsty as the local one for unaccaptable reasons that have been explained and exposed in many books of the time. Adam and Eve leave with Abel and Cain to reinvent life. But the human curse is looming high in the two brothers and the myth they are rerferring to. Here Mel Gibson tells us humanity is nothing but a long history of horrors that constantly repeats itself. Only the forms and the dressings may change.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
This movie was was true to historical events at the time, was immaculately filmed, had a great story,was gripping as well as acceptably gory, was extremely well acted and kept us on the edge of our seats to the very end.
A quite original film by Mel Gibson and perhaps one of the only films portraying the lives of the Maya.  Although a somewhat uncomplicated plot, the original setting,  costumes, and acting, make this film worth watching.<br /><br />The plot is rather formulaic in that it revolves around a captured man attempting to flee his captors and to save his family.  The film is original in that it is set in the Mayan civilization just before the Columbian period and the language is entirely in a Maya dialect.  The cinematography is excellent and the anthropological representations fairly accurate.  The focus of the Mayan civilization's moral decline seems to be a computer recreation of the great city of Tikal which was very well done.  The depictions of human sacrifice were pretty graphic but essentially a fair representation of Meso-American rituals and world views.  The film carries the suspense pretty well all the way through.  Overall, the screenplay was decent, the cinematography excellent, as well as the direction and editing.<br /><br />This was a great film and another accomplishment by Mel Gibson.  This film's results at the box office seem more the result of Mel's anti-semitic faux pas of the time than anything else and shouldn't discourage viewers from renting it on the presumption that the film was bad.
Mel Gibson continues his blossomed directorial deftness with this film.  Gibson's understanding of the proper use of violence within the storyline is akin to Spielberg's of special effects.  Put aside Gibson's personal life, for which he has apologized for and, not to justify his abhorrent and anti-Semitic outbursts for which there is no excuse, had come as an aftermath to Hollywood's own hypocritical hate-filled, discriminatory attacks against him all during the production of "The Passion of the Christ."<br /><br />This film is so-well directed (the non-professional natives used as actors could not have been more believable) and shot (the breakneck lensing and lighting in the rough terrain of an actual rainforect and the complexities of the light shades are expertly captured), it had me wishing Mel Gibson had directed "The Mission"--a film that, while beautiful to watch, lacked the central intensity and edgy-reality it needed to make it compelling.  "Apocalypto" succeeds on all accounts.
Apocolypto was quite good - a movie you cannot look away from - full of action, suspense, brilliant on-location filming.. So what's missing? Well, that is all it has.. the only reason it is good is because it hides behind action.. the characters are supposed to mean a lot to us.. but 99% of the time they only mean a lot to us because they are in danger because they are about to be seriously injured.. this is a technique that is excellent in horror films but if we are expecting a drama or even an intelligent suspense film we want a little more..<br /><br />But enough of my quibbles, mel gibson deserves a great deal of credit for using the original language and for using the people of mexico and for the authentic costumes and all of that jazz... Nevertheless, like most of gibson's films it is essentially adrenaline.. no time for plot... no time for acting.. you are on the run..and you can't look away (this is the type of thing that endangers truly great movie-making.. big budget all action films)...
Mel Gibson's personal imperfections aside, this film is simply a cinematic masterpiece. Visually arresting and thoroughly compelling from start to finish.
This is another classic from Mel Gibson - it's much more in the mould of Braveheart than Passion Of The Christ. Similar to Braveheart, the theme is an individual who is wronged and goes out to get the perpetrators.<br /><br />The cast are all unknown and the film is all done in the Yakutan Mayan ancient language. It is totally subtitled.<br /><br />The main theme of the film is the capture of a Mayan tribe by rivals. The main character Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and child in a cave before seeing his father executed and taken captive. The rest of the villagers are either executed or taken captive to a neighbouring village. The children are left behind. The women are auctioned as slaves and the men are taken for sacrifice to the local pyramid to appease the Sun God. Jaguar Paw watches as several of his colleagues have their heart cut out and are beheaded in a ritual. He is next up but he is saved from this terrible death by a solar eclipse. The sacrifices stop because the local shamen thinks that the sun gods are now pleased. Jaguar Paw and the other men are taken away to be "disposed of". While the rest of the men are executed during a cruel game of 'cat and mouse' in a corn field, a wounded Jaguar Paw kills the son of the chief of the tribe and escapes back into the jungle. He is pursued by about ten men who are going to try and kill him. He must try and return to his wife and child and evade capture.<br /><br />The film contains some beautiful cinematographery and some of the scenery is breathtaking - especially the ancient Mayan costumes, the waterfall, the jungle and the animals. However, the film is also exceptionally gory and violent. I think it's justified in this case. This was a non-Christian society where sacrifice and pillage were the norm.<br /><br />At the back of it all, this film is a good,old-fashioned tale of good versus evil. It's a chase movie without the fast cars. However, it does hold the viewers attention throughout and contains some terrific scenes.<br /><br />The buckets of blood might put a lot of people off but not me...I thought it added to the tension
"Apocalypto" is one of the most amazing films ever made.  It is violent, but not more so than Michael Mann's brilliant "Last of the Mohicans" (1992) and other Academy Award winning films.  However, the misfits of Hollywood--who shape the opinions of the lemmings who follow them in lock step, and who badmouthed "The Passion of the Christ" (2004)--have been at it again.<br /><br />This time they have been hoping "Apocalypto" would fail too.  In the final analysis, Mel Gibson may be laughing all the way to the bank, and rightly so.  A Jewish friend of mine from New York City probably expressed it best:<br /><br />"I have always said that the liberals in Hollywood are the biggest racists in America.  They hide it well!"<br /><br />"Apocalypto" will succeed or fail as a work of art, not based on any attempts to smear Mel Gibson or pander to the racist misfits of Hollywood.<br /><br />There are no recognizable stars in this film; it is spoken in a tongue that is foreign to English-speaking people--which forces the viewer to read the subtitles; and it is about the collapse of at least one civilization, peaceful natives and the pagan Mayans.  In a sense, it is a story about those who worship false gods, as those in Hollywood do today, the gods of power, money and materialism.<br /><br />Hats off to those native "stars" who turned in brilliant performances and made the film come alive.  Those who handled the casting alone, such as Carla Hool, deserve Academy Awards.  So does the cinematographer, Academy Award winner Dean Semler.  Last but by no means least, this may be Mel Gibson's finest film.  Granted it does not have the humor and epic proportions of "Braveheart," but today's directors and those who aspire to the role may be in awe of what Gibson accomplished with this film.
This film blew me away.  Mel Gibson is leagues beyond in terms of cinematographic talent.  The film takes viewers from uproariously hilarious opening scenes to the darkest, saddest and most terrifying scenes and back around to a "new beginning" with a cleverly ironic twist at the end, all in the course of a couple of hours, and without benefit of other than subtitles to carry the story and dialogue.<br /><br />Hollywood needs more, not fewer, Mel Gibsons.  This film got me very excited to see his Jesus pic, which I've reckoned would be good but never had a strong desire to see.  Not anymore; it's on my shortlist!
Too bad that people will boycott this film because Mel can sometimes be a jackass.  It's top notch in every detail.  I've recommended to all my friends and relatives and after a reluctant agreement to watch, all were glad they set their feeling aside and judged the movie on it's own merits.<br />Well worth you time.  bg
What an absolutely incredible film. Beautifully shot, seamless storyline, reality at its finest. Milder 'gore' than some cable fare, but definitely not for the squeamish. The native language added an immeasurable quality to the film and I didn't really notice the subtitles after the first few minutes once I was drawn into the story.
I'm not a fan of Mel Gibson, the person, but as far as this film goes, I'm most certainly a fan of his work.  When I saw ads about this film I finally gave in and bought the dvd, despite my dislike of Gibson.  I'm more than happy I did after seeing this revolutionary work.  If I could give the flick a sixth star I would.  It deserves to be seen over and over again.
I never thought I'd be reviewing a Mel Gibson (Director) movie, as I've never been a fan of his, or his movies, mostly for personal and political reasons. I went into Apocalypto with a skeptical mind, but have to admit, I was blown away by this movie.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart, Apocalypto tells the story of one man's (played superbly by Rudy Youngblood) journey from the quiet, serene woodsman life he and his tribe lead, to literally the steps of human hell and his narrow escape from it. Graphic, horrific, and yet deeply beautiful, Apocalypto is a fast paced rollercoaster ride that grabs you and doesn't let go.<br /><br />My only issue with this movie is it's presentation of a wicked and evil Mayan civilization, which is sheer interpretation and speculation, and I wonder how a movie showing Christian led sacrifices and attrocities would go over with the public. But at least Mel had the right ending when our hero also fears the coming Christian crusaders.<br /><br />See this movie. Just be prepared to be grossed out, shocked and scared, but also leave it feeling grateful for the experience.
I just saw the movie, and I am haunted by it. Watching it, I gasped, cried, and fumed about it. It tells the tale of a young man, who is captured by the Mayans and almost sacrificed. I'll not tell the details, but he escapes, and suddenly is being chased by a large group of guards for about 2 days, never being able to sleep. And he did this so that he could get back to his wife and son.<br />The only thing that kinda bugged me is that I think Gibson made the Mayans appear evil, and I'm not really clear on those details. I do know that the Mayans were very technologically advanced.<br />But definitely watch the movie, and once you see it, think about it a little. You may just want to watch it again. Although it is the type of movie that you wouldn't want to watch over and over again, it still manages to be a classic.
There have been many misunderstandings about this film. I personally do not see the value of expecting every film I watch be historically correct. I also do not expect every film I watch to be politically correct and completely non-offensive. This film is just one vision of the past, it doesn't have to be true.<br /><br />This film is about a young hunter (Jaguar Paw) whose village is destroyed by a rival society, presumably the Mayans. He is captured and separated from his friends, family, his pregnant wife, and first born son. The rest of the story deals with his journey as he attempts to return to his wife and child.<br /><br />The film is full of beautiful views of the rain forest (in Mexico? I'm not sure), and horrific scenes of death. To beat all that, every costume in the film is hand made, which gives the film that extra punch of "realism."<br /><br />I loved this film, and could watch it again and again.
Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" paid a terrible price at the Oscars for its creator's big drunken mouth. No other explanation works. This is, at all technical and crafts levels, an astounding, state-of-the-art movie.<br /><br />Too bad Gibson's ballistic movie couldn't have had one more brief run in theaters, as a last call for fools like me who missed it last year. The film should seen on a big screen. Nonetheless, Buena Vista's single-disc presentation hits all the marks technically. The extras feel pretty skimpy here considering the wild tales about the production down in the jungles of Mexico and the historical potency of its subject matter. No doubt the DVD double-dip is straight ahead via some kind of multidisc collectors set.<br /><br />Gibson's commentary, done with and co-writer Farhad Safinia, has its moments but it's obvious little or no prep time went into that recording. Mostly they gossip about the native actors (some of whom had never seen a movie) and chat about what happened when they filmed this or that scene.<br /><br />The adventure, about Mayan villagers taken into slavery by city-dwellers, has taken heat for one of its historically inaccurate elements. More troubling for casual viewers could be the ridiculous deus ex machina devices that keep things moving along. But nothing waits for logic once the film's great chase gets under way, with a band of warriors in hot pursuit of a resourceful young villager. The movie feels like half of its 139 minute running time.
Many years ago Mel Gibson called me on the phone to ask a favour. "Metamorpho, how would you like a cameo role in the movie I'm making now? It's called Apocalypto." After he told me it was about the Mayan Civilization, I agreed immediately. I was a little annoyed that it wasn't a starring role, but I suppose that's how the pyramid crumbles. I did wonder why he wanted me for the role, so I asked him. "Because you have a good and brave heart Metamorpho," is all he said. To tell you the truth people, I was flattered. It didn't last long.<br /><br />However, I had no time for self-indulgence and went straight to Andy's Antediluvian Culture Costume Center for a wardrobe befitting an esteemed Seer. I picked up all sorts of items pertaining to my role (or so I assumed) as a Mayan Priest. Silver and turquoise jewelry, fine woven togas (red, blue and gold parrot patterns) and a Mayan headress that would make Sitting Bull weep.Yes, I was ready.<br /><br />Anyway, when I got to the set Mel said I didn't need all that attire. "Why not?", I inquired. "Because we're going to paint you blue," is all he said. Well, I tell ya people, communication is really at an ebb these days. Yes, even with the internet. So, after hiding my disappointment I asked him for acting direction. "No problem Metamorpho, just act terrified." I knew that I was capable of that, after all, we all are considering modern day life.<br /><br />But, onwards to the movie itself. Apocalypto is set in the 1500's whereby we are exposed to a culture that no longer exists. The main character, Jaguar Paw, is a young Mayan who is part of a tribe, among many tribes, that frequent the jungle. He and his buddies hunt together, joke together, and share an idyllic existence until a band of warriors invade their village, burn their homes, kill half the people, and take the men prisoner. Flint Eye, Jaguar Paw's father, is killed in front of him but not before Flint Eye says to his son to not be afraid. This is a running theme that guides Jaguar Paw throughout the movie.<br /><br />The captives are then guided through the tracherous terrain of the jungle to a grand Mayan city. Here we are able to glimpse the astounding glory of this civilization. People from all classes, mull around the city, dressed and painted in an array of different ways. The temple pyramid is enormous and we are able to see the vastness of the city stretched out around it. The square, the marketplace, and other pyramids.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, Mel had me play one of the captives. It wasn't fun. Many mosquito bites along the way. But that wasn't the worst of it. Jaguar Paw and all of us were then painted blue and led to the top of the pyramid. From all indication it looked like we were going to be sacrificed to the Gods. I could tell by all the stray heads lying about. No, it wasn't pleasant. And I was thinking, if I get out of this, I am sending Mel a bill for all the clothes that weren't needed. (!)<br /><br />Anyway, we somehow survived and Jaguar Paw somehow managed to escape. I can't give you all the details here, but suffice to say I was impressed in the way that it was done. From this point on it is a chase by the warriors to kill Jaguar Paw. This is when your adrenalin starts to kick in as you see event after event unfold that make the chase even more suspenseful. Mel here, I feel, treats you to another motif. That the jungle, as threatening as it is, is no match for the inhumanity of man. The jungle, at least, can be understood and relied upon for empirical truths. Man, on the other hand, is the most threatening predator of all.<br /><br />There are all sorts of elements in this movie that relate to the overall picture. Too numerous to mention. However, the little leper girl who foretells the warriors ultimate destruction and Jaguar Paw's innate conviction of survival and conquering fear are most noteworthy. Mel paints a harsh and brutal reality, and in many ways it is juxtaposed against our current day world. Things haven't changed much, only the names don't remain the same.<br /><br />In the final analysis, this is a guy's flick. Through and through. Mel gives you more than your equal share of blood and gore. And, just when you think he's through, he gives you more, and then more. The movie is adventurous, harrowing, horrifying and yet you are somehow fascinated and lulled into this world. No, if you're looking for a soft, fuzzy and warm movie then look elsewhere. The Mayan's don't spare anyone, and neither does Mel.<br /><br />The bonus features here really give you an excellent view of how this movie was created. From the detailed building of the city to the painstaking make-up that is unique to the many characters in the film. After seeing this movie, it is clear to me that Mel has become a considerable and very talented director and producer. Whether or not his personal life becomes tarnished by the press, you cannot diminish his ability to tell an effective tale on film.<br /><br />In closing, it took me two days to wash off all the blue paint. I am just glad Mel decided not to mix it with a red colour. I wouldn't want to lose my head, after all. There are certainly more events than I've stated in this movie, but I don't want to disturb your morbid curiosity. Your heart will palpitate for sure.<br /><br />Dread that's read.......... Metamorpho ;)
Apocalypto takes us back to the Americas right before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1492.  The film sheds light on the exotic Mayan civilization as it brings to the screen the tale of a young man captured during a raid, who tries to escape from his captors in order to get home where he has left his wife and child helpless and vulnerable.<br />The movie follows a pragmatic and realistic account of life in the Americas in the 15th Century.  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jaguar Paw, and his quest of returning home to save his family, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), the deteriorating conditions (civil war, decadence, disease, drought, corruption) which led to the decline of the Mayan civilization and its eventual demise at the hands of the Spanish Conquistadors.<br />The cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br />The setting (!), the dialogues, the language (!), the music, and the costumes are all wonderful!<br />Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will definitely provide for an evening's entertainment.<br />In short, Apocalypto is a film you should seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!
APOCALYPTO(2006) Written, Produced and Directed by Mel Gibson. Score by<br />James Horner.<br /><br />  A ho hum film about life in the Mayan empire before Christian<br />civilzation put an end to barbarism and human sacrifice. Numbingly<br />violent and gory with a final half stolen from THE NAKED PREY, this<br />Gibson film is done in by its own blood soaked excess which constantly<br />removes and dulls the viewer to what is a nothing special story in any<br />case. J. Lee Thompson's film KINGS OF THE SUN is a far superior take on<br />the same material in every way.<br /><br />  Hardly a bad film and not more violent from anything from the<br />SAW films to DONNIE BRASCO, anti-Christian bigots set to hate this film<br />because of Gibson being a Catholic take note that you are plunging into<br />an intellectual cul de sac. This is a modern film in nearly every<br />respect---which is to say it is for you.
"Apocalypto" is an R-rated, action-adventure-drama film that came out in 2006.  It is a film about the decline of the Mayan civilization, tribes attacking other tribes, brutal violence, gore, human sacrifice, and primitive warfare - usually involving a lot of death.  There are several Latinas and Latinos in this film (some were genuine Mayan people), along with over 700 extras, with a lot of careful emphasis on realism during the making of the film.  The jungle scenes and sets used were in Mexico, and right down to the last detail it is obvious the amount of effort invested in wardrobe, make-up, and even the Mayan language used in the film was heavily researched to be as authentic as possible.  With a budget of over $ 40 mil, this DVD movie impresses nearly any audience willing to watch a film with subtitles (anybody in the viewing audience translate original Mayan?).  There are lots of lovely women who share their assets with the camera, however, this film makes such an effort at realism that it doesn't seem like gratuitous exploitation eye candy just for the sake of the rating.  I'm guessing the R-rating is mostly for the violence and gore.  Although some of the plot is predictable, I give this 5 stars for keeping me watching without using the FF button on the remote, even though I've seen it three times.  This DVD has a "making of" type extra on it, and the widescreen film presentation is clear, great sound, and perfect color.  The subtitles are tastefully done, and seem to match (as far as I can tell) with the scene.
This is what blu-ray presentation was made for. An absolutely stunning film that uses the technology to the full. Every rustle of the grass, every whisker of the jaguar's face, was picked out with astonishing clarity. I almost felt I had to wipe the humidity of the jungle off my brow as I watched it. The story is a straightforward tale of a community ripped apart by violent outsiders and the struggle for one of its inhabitants to flee from his captors and return to his doomed family. But it is in such simplicity that the story is made. The villains are bad beyond redemption and you long for their deaths, you root for the hero from the moment he is taken, and you prey for a happy ending to his plight - may his family be saved. Gibson knows exactly what he is doing and the viewer actually cares about what they are watching. Before viewing the movie, I was troubled about the level of violence contained in the film and, whilst there is undoubtedly some gore - ripping out a beating heart is never going to be pretty - I found nothing that wasn't essential to the plot or added to the menacing atmosphere of the period depicted. Don't let the lurid tales put you off. As an archaeologist, I was also drawn into the debate about authenticity but such thoughts were quickly banished by the pulsating intensity and sheer brilliance of the film. Similarly, the subtitles are forgotten and the foreign language even adds to the feeling that what you are witnessing is real; this actually happened. Apocalypto is stunning - an experience rather than a movie.
A Mayan forest village lives happily and harmoniously, except the mean teasing of Blunted's inability to sire. When terrified refugees pass, the chief forbids the hunting party to 'spead fear', but the real cause soon follows. Their own community is pillaged, the survivors cruelly enslaved and dragged away. The chief's proud son Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and toddler son, but in an unsafe place. The men are destined for bloody sacrifice to the gods in the raider kingdom's pestilence-stricken capital. An 'auspicious' solar eclipse renders their number superfluous, but the raiders' captain orders them killed as target practice. Jaguar Paw survives, killing the captain's son, and may now incarnate an apocalyptic prophecy or still perish without saving his family, while another danger looms unseen. Apocalypto delivers a rush that does not let up. Brilliant images unlike any showcased in a movie, flash across the screen with dizzying speed. This movie features scene after scene that hits the perfect note, which is always a high-pitched one filled with tension. Apocalypto is the perfect action movie, punctuating its frenzy of activity with beautiful and surprising images. I'm overwhelmed by the experience.
Even with all the controversy surrounding Mel Gibson last year (and doesn't it seem as if each new week brings another celebrity meltdown?), I still looked forward to seeing "Apocalypto."  Why?  If for no other reason--the subject matter, subtitles, and lack of star power made it a bold choice for a major studio release.  Films of this nature generally go into limited distribution to develop an audience and critical word of mouth before expanding, if they ever do.  But with Gibson at the helm, "Apocalypto" debuted with much fanfare and backing just in time to be considered for 2006's Academy Awards.  For some reason, though, I still missed "Apocalypto" at the theaters.  I have heard every description imaginable from those that have seen the film--from the "best movie ever" to "excessively violent and disturbing."  And while I wouldn't go to either of those extremes, "Apocalypto" is certainly an accomplished adventure picture.<br /><br />Set in ancient Mayan times, "Apocalypto" is essentially the harrowing journey of one man, a youth named Jaguar Paw (a convincing Rudy Youngblood).  Living a simple and isolated existence, his tribe are very at home within the forest.  One day, the unthinkable happens.  They are attacked by another group with apparent intentions of enslaving whomever they don't kill.  Youngblood's wife and son are stranded in an underground well, many others are murdered, and Youngblood is among a dozen or so who are rounded up and marched out in bondage.  The subsequent journey leads to a fantastical temple sequence, where it becomes clear that the prisoners are not to become slaves--but sacrifices.  The remainder of the film deals with how Youngblood can escape this situation.  The temple scenes feature a cast of thousands, ritualistic and brutal slayings, and a mob mania that is terrifying and believable.  Racing against the clock to save his wife, Youngblood must escape back through the jungle--where all he has to help him are his cunning and an almost spiritual connection to his surroundings.  The action is practically nonstop, it's inventive, and it is beautifully staged.  Much of "Apocalypto," therefore, is absolutely riveting and wildly entertaining.<br /><br />For the purists who will debate the film's historical accuracy, I will neither deny or confirm the legitimacy of the events that transpire within "Apocalypto."  While there do seem to be some liberties taken with the historical timeline (as evidenced by a surprise in the ending--which I enjoyed despite its implausibility), I really don't think that this film aspires to be a "historical document."  Gibson has made an adventure story using a Mayan backdrop.  The feel and look of his picture stay as valid as possible to the timeframe, however, I never interpreted this picture as a "true" story.  Guess what?  Fictional liberties are taken in every motion picture.  Otherwise every motion picture would be a documentary--and even documentaries have an angle or slant which make them less than "true" in many cases.  "Apocalypto," at heart, is an effective action picture that makes interesting use of its Mayan setting.<br /><br />I guess "Apocalypto" is not for the squeamish--however, the violence depicted is by no means unusual by modern film standards.  You can see much worse in today's "torture" cinema, those films that pass for horror with current audiences.  I suppose what makes "Apocalypto" more vivid is that the violence is in a believable context.  There are some beheadings and some hunting scenes, but the brutality is intrinsic to the story "Apocalypto" is telling.  I don't believe serious minded filmgoers will be put off by seeing some savagery depicted in a film about ancient Mayan cultures--it's not as if this is a Merchant/Ivory production with tea parties and witty banter.<br /><br />I do recommend "Apocalypto."  Beautifully filmed, the technical merits of the film are beyond reproach.  The cinematography, score, and editing all enhance this exciting tale.  I imagine these elements really shone bright for those who saw this on the big screen. A great action picture that is for adults--check it out. KGHarris, 03/07.
A welcome change of pace for us who feel Hollywood keeps making the same picture over and over again. The first part of this film is the most unconventional but also hard to endure as only bad things seem to happen to the characters but once Act II arrives and the chase begins, grab on !. I can't remmember the last time a film had my stomach in knotts like this one.<br />Some people here in Mexico have complained about the film's historical accuracy since by the time the Spanish arrived in America, the Mayan civilization had already been taken over by other groups. In any case, Hollywood films are not the best way to learn about history.<br />When Braveheart came out over 10 years ago I remmember a friend telling me: "who would have thought Mel Gibson was a real director", 2 films later he keeps surprising me with his directing skills. It's too bad the public has let themselves be convinced by the media that he's the most evil person to ever come out of Hollywood which is absurd. I guess they feel the more they discredit him the more they discredit "The Passion of the Christ".<br />Great work Mel !
Apocalypto is a story about a Mayan man's, Jaguar Paw, epic journey.  His peaceful, content village is attacked by a superior tribe and his people are slaughtered and enslaved.  He escapes and has to deal with great obstacles while trying to race back to save his wife and child.<br /><br />When I first heard what this was about and saw the trailer I feared that Mr. Gibson was losing his touch.  The movie looked plain boring.<br /><br />I can't remember the last time I have been so wrong.<br /><br />I work for a production company that made a film with Mr. Gibson in the past and decided to write him to share how I felt about his work.  Below is a copy of the letter I sent him:<br /><br />"Dear Mr. Gibson,<br /><br />I am writing to tell you how beautiful and powerful I think Apocalypto is.  I first saw it one month ago and have seen it four more times since.  I believe it is one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />The story was magnificently crafted with characters and emotions I found I could easily relate to.  It triggered emotions within me as I watched.  I laughed hard with the characters.  And I felt their fear, pain, hatred, love and desire.  The gaps (between expectation and reality) were opened wider than in any movie I've seen in a very long time.  My mind throbbed with contemplation when the old story teller told his people of how man took until the Earth had nothing left to give.  I grew uneasy as I realized the similarities between the Mayan narcissism and that of great civilizations since, especially our (America's) own.<br /><br />The epic chase was powerful and cerebral.  Jaguar Paw's exhaustion and need was palpable.  It is the greatest chase ever - better than The Fugitive.<br /><br />The cinematography was bold and vibrant.  When combined with the powerful sound and fantastic casting, the story took hold of me from the opening scene right through to the credits.<br /><br />Mr. Gibson, you have become one of my favorite directors.  You now have two films on my short, all-time-favorite-movies list, which includes American Beauty, Braveheart, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction and RKO 281.  Apocalypto not only entertains, it evokes strong emotion and inspires soulful contemplation.  Apocalypto is a true masterpiece.  You are a master storyteller.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />[Scrutinizing Consumer]"
Apocalypto `s main merit resides in the original treatment which received this story placed in the Maya era. The film was planned according the classic patterns of a symphony of just three movements. The First one is the warmth Adagio where the viewer realizes the rituals and customs of a pacific tribe, and a casual encounter with a foreign tribe, the second movement has to do with the violent scenes of fight and defeat of the pacific tribe, whose leader: "Jaguar paw" will undertake the epic challenge to survive along the dynamic final movement And through the first two movements everything is OK, but the febrile human chase along the last third of movie is what it deserves the jewel of the crown. Shocking sequences and chilling fact will happen that will hold fixed to your seat. Gibson recreates the hero's journey with absolute realism with some commercial concessions here and there, that don't avoid the spectacular dynamic of the movie.<br /><br />Go for this one!
Mel Gibson does it yet again - bigger and better!<br /><br />Whether you love him or hate him, obviously the vast majority rule that Mel Gibson can not only act, but direct movies with the best of them. The tale of the tail tells all.<br /><br />Hoo-hum Box Office sales, but the lead in DVD sales. That's with no doubt due to his ranting and subsequent arrest. But overlying all of this is the absolute high quality of storytelling and savage beauty he can lend to a film. This is without a doubt one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />Filled with such raw beauty and savage violence, Gibson is smart enough to balance it with showing the love and caring his characters evoke. Not just rely on great action seqeunces, or special effects. The downfall of many a director.<br /><br />This movie shines beautifully on my 65-inch HD T.V. Better than the theater. If you don't own a huge HD TV, then you must purchase one to get the full effect of such awesome filmed movies.<br /><br />A must have for your library.
The Mayan Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) gets caught up in a late pre-Columbian (or early Columbian, depending on whose ships those are at the end of the movie) political, religious and social conflict that requires him to survive his village being sacked, being carried away captive, almost sacrificed to a false god, and run for his life while fighting a pack of bloodthirsty warriors in a cross-country obstacle course that combines the best of "The Most Dangerous Game" and First Blood.<br /><br />There's lots of Braveheart-type directing in this movie, which means people yelling and waving blunt weapons as they run, slow-mo, directly toward the camera.  There's lots of hand-to-hand combat that doesn't spare the viewer any gory details.  If you happen to like that type of directing and action -- I know *I* do -- then this is a great movie for you.  Cinematography is superb, sets are lavish, and everyone is in top form.  It's just a well-crafted picture, top to bottom.<br /><br />One other thing.  For me, the subtext of this movie was not so much about the ending of one world -- an apocalypse -- by invasion from another.  The subtext is also not about how morally decayed civilizations are ripe for destruction from outside.  No, for me it's much more personal.  This is something I would've missed when I was younger but is obvious now.  The most important subtext of this movie is "What would you do for your family"?  The answer is, of course, Anything.
Mel Gibson is obviously a controversial filmmaker. It is nearly impossible to avoid addressing that here but I'm going to try really hard. Suffice to say, Apocalypto is a very violent and brutal film that portrays the Mayan civilization in a way that troubles some Anthropologists. None of that really matters to most viewers though and I'm here to tell you that most viewers will find that this movie is about as intense and compelling as you can get.<br /><br />Apocalypto is two kinds of action sub-genres mended together in an amazing setting that most viewers will find authentic. It is an action chase film smattered with revenge elements typical of a Gibson movie. Apocalypto opens like Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, with no credits and instead a quotation alluding to the theme of a civilization in decline. The quote is from historian Will Durant and states: "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within." The civilization in this movie is the ancient Mayan civilization and there is a genuine attempt at convincing the audience we are watching from a time machine. Again, like The Passion of the Christ, Gibson refuses to use English and instead goes with Yucatec Mayan, which may or may not be exactly what these people spoke but I have to applaud Gibson for doing this. I can tell you one thing, it hooked me in a lot more than English would have and helped me delve a little deeper and go back in time a little more efficiently than most historical depictions by a long shot. I didn't need my imagination at all. I can't say enough about Gibson's ability to get his audience into the hearts and minds of his characters and their settings. We also get a relatively unknown but talented cast of Native Americans, which itself serves to accentuate the film's authenticity as we have no prior references to the actors' faces.<br /><br />Apocalypto, in perspective, runs as a political parallel and comments on a civilization in decline. However, like most action films, it focuses on one protagonist as we root for his survival and safe resolution to his goals. His name is Jaguar Paw and he is a Mayan man with a young son and a pregnant wife. To avoid spoilers, I'll just say that he ends up having an improbably horrendous few days. He and his friends get a good look at how the Mayan civilization is in decline from greed, disease, self-destruction, failed crops, slavery and of course human sacrifice...you will not forget the human sacrifice. This is hell on Earth but Jaguar Paw is up to the task and I couldn't help but root for him out loud on various occasions as I watched. That alone praises the film's passion. I bought into this movie entirely while watching it and it even prompted me to learn more and study the points of contention many people have with Gibson's depiction. A lot of movies that reference history can get folks thinking and whatever you may find in terms of truth, perhaps it is that provocation alone makes Apocalypto effective.
Just got my DVD copy today - almost a week before the official release. As far as Bonus Features, it has:<br />- Audio Commentary by Mel Gibson and Farhad Safinia (Co-Producer/Writer)<br />- Deleted scene (not worth the trouble - less than 40 seconds)<br />- Documentary: "Becoming Mayan: Creating Apocalypto" (25 minutes)<br />For specs, it has DTS 5.1 surround, DD 5.1 SS, Original Mayan Language track. Subtitles: English, French and Spanish. Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1<br />  Fabulous movie. Great exotic locale (even language).  Many critics complain about the historical inaccuracy of about 30-40 seconds (The landing of the Spaniards at the time of the Mayas - almost like a day of judgment) and disregard the remaining 130+ minutes. Do the math to see if it's worth complaining. Others, about the portrayal of Mayans as ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's a movie that portrays love of freedom, of life and family in face of evil aggression. Evil? How else would you call a culture so involved in human sacrifice? I wonder how some critics would react if they were on top of that pyramid with Jaguar Paw...
Since others have focused on the movie itself, I ask you to read their reviews for a review of the content. I want to focus on the quality of the encode instead.<br /><br />For a short review of the film, I will say that it is action packed and nicely done, though I found the story slightly sparse; like the action took precedence over story.<br /><br />It's also pretty violent in places, which is fine by me, but may not be everyone's cup of tea.<br /><br />As far as the disc is concerned, the Blu-Ray presentation is phenomenal.<br /><br />For video encoding Buena Vista chose to use the AVC/MPEG4 format. The encode is what you'd expect from HD; crisp and clear. There are no compression issues or any other perceptible visual anomalies present. It just looks darn good! The only real issue is the use of different film stocks. What you have is more grain in some areas due to the use of certain film stocks, while in others you have crisp clarity. This is as the movie is supposed to be presented, but if you don't realize why the change in "quality" it can be a bit confusing.<br /><br />As far as audio is concerned, I commend Mel Gibson for his use of authentic languages on his films. The LPCM 5.1 audio (uncompressed) is absolutely clear and problem free. The channels have good separation when needed and it works really well in the Mayan language. There is also a more compatible Dolby Digital 5.1 track, listed as English, though this is not the case. There is only the Mayan language available on this release; no English language dub. You have to watch with subtitles, so if subtitles aren't your thing, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Extras are presented in standard DVD resolution (480p). This is somewhat disappointing, but my guess is that the footage was shot on digital and not digital HD equipment. Hopefully in the future companies will record things in HD and present the entire package, not just the film, in HD. The film is what really matters, but standard def extras are slightly disappointing.<br /><br />Over all I am happy with this release. The movie itself was good, but not "great" for me, while the technical aspects make the Blu-Ray presentation shine.
"Apocalypto," not "Braveheart," was the film for which Mel Gibson should have won an Oscar. Whatever you may think of Gibson as a man, he shows himself in "Apocalypto" to be an extraordinarily daring, extraordinarily gifted writer-director.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is as grand, expansive and panoramic as anything Cecil B. DeMille ever attempted, meticulously recreating the Mayan culture and civilization of the 16th century at the exact moment before the Spaniards arrived. But in its narrative sweep, intensity, realism, and sense of tragedy, "Apocalypto" leaves DeMille in the dust. There is nothing stilted about "Apocalypto;" you feel you are really there, living the anguish of Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a jungle hunter and warrior, as he tries to flee from a cruel Mayan death squad and reunite with his pregnant wife and small son.<br /><br />This being a Mel Gibson film, be warned that the level of violence in "Apocalypto" is very high, and Jaguar Paw comes in for a LOT of punishment. Nevertheless, once you have seen "Apocalypto," you will never forget it. It deserves to be ranked among the classic cinematic epics.
My favourite movie for sure, nothing has ever come close. I'm personally into indigenous living and especially self-sufficient living.<br /><br />The movie is about a small tribe of jungle dwellers in the age of Mayan domination. These people are not part of the 'great' Mayan civilization, they live in isolated freedom. They are self-sufficient jungle-dwellers who take everything they need from the forest, build their own shelter, hunt and forage. This true freedom gets destroyed by the dominating city state, whose servants go to the jungle to collect jungle dwellers to sacrifice to the gods and for slavery.<br /><br />This story is not gonna give you a history lesson on the 'great technological advancements and accomplishments' of the dominating city states. But it sure is a perfectly correct insight into the conflict between, on the one hand, domination, controlled 'empires' and mass ignorance, and on the other hand, autonomous, self-sufficient living off the land.<br /><br />The main character's quest is to save himself from execution and reunite with his young family, but the way I saw it was more than that. A deep, ever relevant conflict between the two worlds and ways of life. And this movie's deeply caring desire to tackle this most important topic of all would almost be enough to call it one of the best ever. But it's also very well presented, thrilling and visually stunning, with an intense yet comfortable attention to detail.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that for some strange reason all these wilderness people were perfectly clean shaven, straight out of a Gillette advert. This may be historically correct, though I struggle to believe that these natural people would find a reason to shave. Other than this minor flaw, I found nothing wrong with the movie. Mel Gibson has done it again.
This movie is a must have collectors item. It demonstrates and captures native people without bias. Everything was "le-natural", all prior to the spanish conquistadors or the european invasion/occupation. Put simply, you will see how a society lived without a central government, militia, commerce, business, schools, hospitals, electricity or technology. This movie brings to life at close range a peak into what it was like in the everyday life of native people of the americas in an unpolluted  environment. You will see mother earth and a people co-exist in harmony. You will see how different tribes interact, some peacefully, others fiercely. Conclusion, you will honestly appreciate this movie. You hardly have to read the subtitles because the movie is so visual. Outstanding!
This is a fantastic movie and has one of the best pictures that blu-ray has to offer.
I love this movie!  I love that it's done in the authentic language, it tells a powerful story, it is quite the thriller, and it has a great ending!  I would recommend this movie to anyone!
What took so long for a movie about the mayans or other similar culture to be made? I don't know of any others besides this one. Mel Gibson decided to make this movie totally realistic. It's a grimy, dirty, 100% real looking version of Mayan civilization. I was expecting it to be more hollywood, i.e. more beautiful and artistic looking, but it's not like that. It's not like a Cecil B DeMille movie. This movie is not so much like a movie but more like traveling back in time and looking at the real Mayans with your own eyes. But there's also an exciting adventure story in it. And it has the OBLIGATORY love story that every movie must have in order to attract female viewers and make a profit? Fortunately, the love story is a very minor aspect of Apocalypto, unlike other movies such as Titanic. Personally I'm not interested in seeing love stories in Historical movies! The warrior captain looks like he came straight out of a Mad Max movie. In fact the story of this movie is vaguely reminiscent of Mad Max. Apocalypto seems to have a lot of things vaguely in common with many of Mel Gibson's other movies. At the same time I felt kind of like I was watching a historical film on PBS. This movie is more serious-minded than your typical summer action movie. At one point I stopped being horrified at the human sacrifice scene and started to appreciated it on a historical level. By the way, the Mayan culture was very cruel, sadistic, bloody, and demonic. I can see why the missionaries erased that culture. I'm not sure, but maybe they were even right to do so. Their culture was very interesting, but so evil.<br /><br />Apocalypto is not enough! I want to see more movies about the Mayans, Aztecs, etc. I would like to see a movie about the Spanish conquest of the mayans and aztecs. That would also be a lot of bloody good fun, if you know what I mean :) I also want to see a LOT more of those ancient temples, pyramids, palaces, etc. I didn't feel like I got to see as much of the buildings as I wanted to in Apocalypto.
This movie is a clue to the countdown to the year 2012, the Mayan calender stops here. The ultimate message that is given to Jaguar Paw from his dying father is not to fear! This movie rocks and I am planning on getting it so I can watch it many times over. Good shall win over evil.
The cinemantography was incredible. It was also probably the most bloody violent movie I have ever seen. I'm not a gore freak but I didn't mind. It has the greatest chase scene that has ever been in a movie. But the real purpose of this movie isn't action or gore. Its obviously an allegory for America. It starts with this quote<br /><br />  "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."<br /><br />It begins in a small jungle village where the people are strong, healthy, family oriented. Then they are captured by a different Mayan tribe in a raid and taken to their city which shows what a rotting society they have. You begin to see decadence, many people are physically fat and deformed, stealing, gluttony, people being enslaved, corrupt lying con artist type leaders, etc. I mean it really is a mesoamerican version of America.<br /><br />You also have a very politically incorrect view of the Mayan Indians. Besides the sickness that is their rotting civilization it also shows the utter violent cruelty that these people indulge in. Many of the politically correct have howled about Apocalytpo.<br /><br />Almost all of Mels movies show someone standing up to corrupt governments in a brave noble way. There is a theme of not succuming to fear and allowing it to dictate how you live your life in most of his films also. This guy makes great movies. He also knows the deal about the new world order and what is going on now, and who is responsible for it. I suspect that eventually Gibson is going to fully come out of the closet so to speak on the NWO issue and lay it all out for the world in plain English instead of the thinly veiled allegories that are in the movies he makes now.
It is so unfortunate that a simple yet profound film is being misunderstood by shallow interpretations and subjective, personal convictions.<br />Here are, what I think, the main points of this film:<br /><br />-It's not the gore! I am constantly amazed at how viewers see this movie as only a 'gory', 'bloody' film that wasted their two hours. Point is, if you felt that you wasted your time, it was your fault you did not digest this film. The movie was indeed gory, but you can only appreciate this film if you look past beyond it. And most of the things you don't want to see have to be seen anyway. Most of us don't like looking at dead bodies, but one way or another, we eventually will have to. That's one way we can truly appreciate life and being alive. Why so much bloodshed? That's how much the lesson is worth.<br /> And please do not compare this film with those horror/suspense movies. That is too superficial.<br /><br />-To conclude that 'Apocalypto' paints a bad picture of the Mayans (and other 'Mesoamerican' civilizations) is misinterpreting the film. No human civilization can ever be deemed truly peaceful, and Mayans are not exempt from this. Their human sacrifices are well-documented, and some of their victims unwilling. Do we blame them? No--we have to understand that their civilization subsisted on this belief. They are no better or worse because of their culture.<br /> Regardless of historical accuracy, the sacrifice scene was set during a famine/plague, and thus the need for sacrifice. Take note that the 'peaceful' tribespeople killed were also Mayan (if not culturally, then at least ethnically). The Mayans are depicted as neither good nor evil; individuals are depicted as either good or evil. And that is still subjective, depending on the way you see it (Jaguar Paw was only chased after he killed the chieftain's son; and that was to defend himself. And the chieftain had a right to hunt him down because of this. So who was right/wrong?)<br /><br />-Those who think that this film is racist (Mel Gibson's convictions notwithstanding) are racists themselves. It is very obvious that it was never the intention of the film to portray the Europeans in a positive light; in fact, the ships spelled doom for the Mayan way of life (historically inaccurate or not). Political Correctness is the worst bias to bring when watching this film; we should not interpret the Mayan world using our own 'modern' worldview.<br /><br />-Ultimately, if one goes beyond the gore, the personal bias and the outstanding cinematography, 'Apocalypto' is a very simple, human tale that transcends its setting and cultural trappings.<br /> It is a story of loss and the awakening to a harsh reality and the desire to defend one's family, land and way of life. It is a story of the power of the human will to live.
This is not the best movie I have seen this year, but probably the best movie I have seen in the last decade! This is a movie I'll be watching over and over again. I enjoy movies that are historical, true stories, challenge my mind, entertain me, offer me stunning imagery, are provocative, and os&eacute; (daring). This movie offered me all of this with stunning cinematography. This is an intense (very intense) non-stop action movie.<br /><br />The movie is set in an ancient Central American civilization days prior to its discovery by the Europeans. The story revolves around a young hunter, Jaguar Paw, and his pregnant wife and young son, who live in a small village within the Mayan empire. If you have read the books by Jared Diamond (Collapse; Guns, Germs, and Steel), you'd have a good idea of the Mayan Civilization and its impact on its environment and subjects. I highly recommend you read both books.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is captured by Mayan soldiers and is taken to the great Mayan city, where, along with his captured companions, is to be offered as sacrifice to the gods. Meanwhile, his wife and son are stuck in a well, where they hid from the invading Mayan soldiers, and if no one rescues them soon, they will die. To make matters worse, it starts raining heavily, and the well quickly fills up with water, putting the wife and son at risk of drowning. To complicate things further, the wife goes into labor while immersed in water up to her neck, with her young son on her shoulders. She eventually gives birth, and the newborn baby suddenly emerges from the water. The expression on the young boy's face upon seeing his baby brother is beyond words. This is the most memorable scene in the movie and one that will stay with you for a long time. It is rare to have Hollywood portray scenes with such strong emotions. Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Will Jaguar Paw be able to rescue his family before they drown? Will he be able to rescue himself? His head is on the altar ready to be beheaded as offering to the gods. What could possibly happen to save him, and in turn, save his family?<br /><br />This is a movie you have to watch. Five stars alone do not do justice for such a masterpiece!

Very focused on the main character, but amazing attention to detail on all the movie's periphery.
I might be strange, but I liked this movie a lot. It seemed very authentic. I enjoyed it so much that I forgot that it used subtitles, and that is not an easy thing to do.
Mel Gibson does it again,this time as director.You are given an insite into life in the wilds of South American.An ancient civilization and their treatment of other peoples for God worship.Savage and Brilliant you won't be able to take your eyes from the screen.
A poetic work. It is hard not to see the parallels between our society and the twilight of the ancient Mayans. This is a life-affirming tale that values human dignity over what humanity often degrades into. A brilliant cast and crew drives home a message of hope too often missed today.
This is an intense action-adventure giving us a glimpse into the end of days of the Mayan civilization. The film is beautifully photographed, acted, directed, and scripted (in subtitles). Mel Gibson is a brilliant director, with this being a beautiful piece of work...it is a crime it was snubbed at the Oscars.
Here you can see Gibson's vision of the Mayan kingdom as it faces its decline, the rulers insist the key to prosperity is to build more temples and offer human sacrifices. Jaguar Paw is a young man who is captured for sacrifice, but flees to avoid his fate. He is taken on a perilous journey to a world that is ruled by fear and oppression, where a harrowing end awaits him. Through a twist of fate and spurred by the power of his love for his woman and his family he will make a desperate break to return home and to ultimately save his way of life. Though the film has historical inaccuracies, it does show the behavior that caused its decline. This movie is fast paced, but be aware it has violent scenes.
Apocalypto was a powerfully, impressive, emotionally painful movie to experience. I have watched it 10 times in the 3 weeks I have owned the DVD. It is a must see for all ages because it allows the viewer to experience all the emotions life has to offer.
Mel Gibson does a Really Good Job at directing and Bringing this Story. very strong and very Raw. from start to finish you get the most basics of Human conditions and it becomes the Hunter and the Prey. Rudy YoungBlood does a Great Job in this Movie. the running and escaping each possible Deadly situations. I was pulling for dude at the end when he had to save His Lady and there Kids in the water. that dive into the water falls was something else. the Intensity of the film kept you on the edge of your seat. a must see and very intense film.
Mel Gibson has offered a candid look at one of the most eccentric cultures in the western hemisphere. This action-soaked adventure takes  you for a ride and doesn't let you off until the very end.<br />The protagonist, Jaguar Paw is captured, along with  the survivors of his village, and taken to the ancient Mayan city, where he is to be offered up as a blood sacrifice in one of the infamous Mayan rituals. Jaguar Paw then makes one of the most exciting attempts to escape certain death that I have seen on film in a few years.From the ancient Mayan city through barren fields, to the rain forest, Jaguar Paw struggles to elude his dogged pursuers from without, and the enemy from within, fear.<br />This movie is a sure bet if it's action you are looking for. It also piques the curiosity about ancient Mayan civilization. It took me a while to get into the subtitles, but the actors speaking in the native tongue lend a certain authenticity to the overall experience.
This is an interesting film. It is an adventure story set in Meso-America just before the arrival of Europeans. The film does not name the culture portrayed, though I have heard some refer to it as Mayan, but it strikes me as very "Aztec" in its depiction. By that, I mean that there is plenty of gore, cruelty and human sacrifice.<br />The story is of a fairly rural village that is happy enough and getting by. One morning they awake to find that they are being raided by a war party from the "big city". Most of the adults are captured and led off into slavery in the big city. For the women, slavery means servitude. For the men, it is much less pleasant.<br />The men find themselves painted blue and taken to the top of a large pyramid where the local priests are systematically sacrificing them, cutting out their hearts to burn on an altar, lopping off the heads and sending the corpses to tumble down the steps for the amusement and nourishment of the locals. When a solar eclipse is finally over with, there is no further need of the captives.<br />The remaining men are taken out to play a game where they are promised their freedom is they successfully run a bloodthirsty gauntlet. When one of the captives manages to kill the son of a leader and make it to the woods, the chase is on. The remainder of the film involves the chase and the effort to stay alive as the hunted becomes the hunter.<br />As I opined before, this was a very interesting film but it was not very enjoyable.
Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" (2006) starts out like a Mayan version of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783241895">Conan the Barbarian</a>" with the raid and destruction of a forest village and then morphs into a horror story as the captives are babarically sacrificed at the Mayan pyramids to appease their gods; the final act turns into a jungle chase reminiscent of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GJUOGC">The Naked Prey</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LVAQDE">Rambo: First Blood</a>". It also has elements of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305609705">Apocalypse Now</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2WP7O">The Last of the Mohicans</a>." With the exception of "The Naked Prey," "Apocalypto" isn't quite as good as any of these films, but it's still a very good jungle adventure.<br /><br />What makes "Apocalypto" a must is the simple fact that there aren't ANY other significant films that depict the Mayan civilization. Just as "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F34HT6">Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan</a>" brought to life the infamous Mongol conqueror and his people, so "Apocalypto" effectively brings to life the Mayans.<br /><br />The spoken language is Mayan with subtitles, but this is mainly a visual experience as there's no elaborate dialogue.<br /><br />There's not much else to say. This is essentially a film about the death throes of a civilization and the dawning of a new era. On a more individualist level, it's about recognizing one's true identity, denying fear and the bold spirit of survival. These themes are conveyed with nigh wall-to-wall jungle action and horror.<br /><br />The film was shot in Mexico and runs 2 hours and 19 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: B+
This movie was awesome..Mel Gibson did a great job and kept you on the edge of your seat.  I would definitely recommend it.
I really liked this movie, i was looking for it long time ago. I finally get it on blu-ray and low price.
I've been looking for this movie for a longtime and to be able to get it at this price makes it better.I'm very happy with it.
i saw this in cable on a saturday morning very early for the first time. i had to buy the dvd for my collection so i could have it to watch again or share. i was lucky to find hhis seller who offered it at a treat price. it arrived in brand new condition super fast. thanks.
get ready to read. have to read all the lines in captions but still no matter what you need to see this movie at least once. beautiful movie.
Mel Gibson is not unfamiliar with controversy both as a director and in his personal life. The Oscar-winning Braveheart (1995) was a good but historically inaccurate film while The Passion of the Christ (2004) was brutal and caused outrage with some accusations of Anti-Semitism. With Apocalypto Gibson left himself open to further debate in his depiction of the Maya civilization in decline just before the arrival of the Spanish colonists, first spearheaded by Christopher Columbus.<br /><br />In terms of the story Apocalypto is very simple with the visuals and action being given more prominence than the plot. Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is part of a peaceful Maya tribe living deep in the jungle when his people are attacked by raiders, tying up their victims to be marched through the harsh terrain to their majestic city where a Maya King awaits. Jaguar Paw manages to hide his heavily pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and young son Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Baez) before being captured by the raiders, led by the ruthless but at times merciful Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo). After being taken to the Maya City, the women are sold as slaves while Jaguar Paw and the rest of the men are put forward to be sacrificed. When it is Jaguar Paw's turn an eclipse suddenly covers the sun and the Maya onlookers are in fear but a priest assures those gathered that they have appeased the sun god Kukulkan and there is no further need for sacrifice. Jaguar Paw and the other men are sent to be killed but Jaguar Paw manages to escape and begins a perilous journey home to his family with Zero Wolf and a band of warriors in hot pursuit.<br /><br />With a very basic story being offered to the audience we are left to rely on some impressive visuals, sweeping panoramic shots of the jungle, waterfalls and then the devastated terrain surrounding the Mayan city that Jaguar Paw and the rest of his village are marched towards. The Meso-American landscape is simply breathtaking and the Mayan city with the temple perched atop a seemingly endless stairway is magnificent to behold. Gibson sensibly opted to have Apocalypto use Yucatec Maya dialogue with English subtitles which makes for a more authentic experience. We are given an insight into Mayan culture with methods of hunting, worship of gods, sense of humour and practical jokes, and finally brutal warfare all being prevalent throughout the two hours.<br /><br />The film's opening with Jaguar Blood joining his father, Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), and a group of hunters in the pursuit of a tapir has an inevitable outcome and leaves little to the imagination. Apocalypto does have scenes that some audiences may find difficult to watch. Zero Wolf's raid at the outset is organised but cruel as families are separated with children being left behind. Adults are clearly the only ones of any worth when it comes to slavery and human sacrifice. Jaguar Paw immediately gets on the wrong side of the vicious Middle Eye (Gerardo Taracena) who is eager to kill the film's hero only to be stopped by Zero Wolf. In response Middle Eye makes a show of killing Jaguar Paw's father instead. Middle Eye's violent nature shows no sign of relenting particularly in the journey to the Maya city where he watches a group of slaves, including Jaguar Paw, almost be dragged from a cliff by one wounded and exhausted Maya slave. Middle Eye simply waits to see if the quartet of slaves can haul themselves back to the surface and when they do he cuts the wounded Maya loose and hurls him from the cliff. His actions earn a fierce reprimand from Zero Wolf but no further action is taken. Human sacrifice is also unpleasant in Apocalypto with hearts being removed followed by beheadings and torsos thrown down stairways. This element of the film has been frowned upon for the Aztecs were said to be purveyors of mass sacrifice while the Maya performed it on a minimal scale. Finally, Jaguar Paw's chance of escape comes when two slaves are released at a time by Zero Wolf and told to run towards a field of corn and beyond that the dense jungle. While the Maya slaves run for freedom, Zero Wolf and his men proceed to use them as target practice! Jaguar Paw escapes this fate but is wounded in the process and endures a horrific journey home with Zero Wolf, Middle Eye and a handful of other hunters close behind.<br /><br />The lack of a major storyline is a negative point to Apocalypto but the fighting is brutal but excellent in its execution. The performances are all very good as well and even with a somewhat predictable ending it still leaves a bittersweet taste. Gibson found himself in the midst of controversy again with Apocalypto with depictions of the Maya said to contain many inaccuracies. The Maya are somewhat one dimensional, simply hunters and warriors, whereas in history they were great innovators as well, somewhat lacking in the film. The arrival of the Spanish is said to put the film's events in history around 1502, Columbus' fourth expedition to America but this is also said to be far from the truth. Delving into the facts does hinder a film. I found that with Braveheart after reading two biographies about William Wallace and I know the same is true of Apocalypto. Like Braveheart, Apocalypto will always be frowned on for historical inaccuracy but some elements ring true and a good film is still to be found beneath the controversy.<br /><br />Apocalypto is lacking in a major storyline but the insight into Mayan culture is fascinating. It's violent in places but remains enthralling throughout and the final segment of the film with Jaguar Paw being pursued through the jungle is an exciting cat and mouse chase which is brought to an end in very surprising fashion. Uncompromising but good in equal measure, Apocalypto has much to offer.
One of  Mel Gibsons best films, and one your sure to remember a classic for sure excellent acting and story leaves one thinking how close it came to the truth.
When I first watched "Apocalypto" in 2006 I thought is was a masterpiece. Watching it again confirms my initial reaction to the movie, it is an excellent piece of filmmaking that will be watched, and talked about for decades to come. Had it been directed by anyone other than Mel Gibson it would have won Best Picture or at least Best Director.  The script, performances, cinematography and direction are flawless, but what sets it apart as an action adventure film is its primeval truth of the human condition.<br /><br />The film may not be the literal truth of the Mayan civilization, although Gibson and writer Farhad Safinia say they did a great deal of research, many scholars point out inaccuracies. Nevertheless, its real power as a movie experience is not its historical accuracy, but its historical imagining --perhaps unintentional on Gibson's part--of what tens of thousands of years of  homo sapien history may have been like; the hunt by a small hunter gatherer tribe, another tribe moving thru its territory, the potential for violence, the offering to avoid it; the stronger, more advanced tribe that has discovered a technological edge, overpowering and enslaving a weaker neighboring tribe,the violence and cruelty towards an alien group, and the loyalty to his own tribe. The Mayans represent a people who have made the transition to agriculture, city state, a political hierarchy, and are on the verge of an apocalypse brought about by hubris and ignorance.  The Mayans are stand ins for countless other unknown civilizations lost in prehistory, but they are also our antecedents.<br /><br />The second half of the film is a metaphor, presented as a thrilling chase, of humanity's genius and luck in surviving and ultimately thriving against all the odds. Jaguar Paw and family are the victors of those conflicts, and survivors of an apocalypse; they are our ancestors, we are here because of them. The uncomfortable violence, and cruelty depicted in the film, is the truth of that journey.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is superb on many different levels, as a thrill ride, Gibson's filmmaking skills are second to none but  at the narrative level it achieves that elusive quality of art. Make no mistake, this is one of the most emotionally brutal movies ever made, which is why it succeeds to illuminate the human condition at a level that few works of art, let alone movies, dare even attempt, or if attempt, fail.
No matter what you may think of Mel Gibson as a person, his film Apocalypto (2006) is truly an example of superb storytelling, and the realization of a vision to bring to the screen a period piece involving the Mayan culture, that is epic in scale, and brutally realistic, as a marauding band of warriors raids the jungle and gathers slaves.<br /><br />Set somewhere in the jungles of Central America, the movie's cast speak an archaic language, wear authentic attire, and use ancient tools and weapons.  Tattoos, scarification, piercing, and the insertion of objects into parts of the body, particularly the nose and ear lobe, were part of the Mayan culture, and a large crew of makeup artists, was employed to give the huge cast an authentic look.  Unfolding in stages, the story immediately draws you in, and is largely a learning experience, for those unfamiliar with the Mayan culture.  The acting performances are amazingly natural, and there are few instances where you don't feel that what you are seeing isn't real.  The pacing is brisk, and the story is told in a manner that feels like events are happening almost in real time.<br /><br />Events are centered on a young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the son of Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead), one of the leaders of a tribe living in the jungle.  With the goal of capturing alive as many of the adults as possible, a group of warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), and his lieutenant Middle Eye (Gerardo Teracena), attack Jaguar Paw's tribe.  The struggle is furious, brutal, and heartbreaking, as the film brilliantly captures the pure panic, naked fear, and cruel violence, as the tribe is overrun, struggles to resist, and is overcome by the superior force.<br /><br />During the fray, Jaguar Paw manages to lower his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and his son into a deep pit, where they barely escape detection.  After watching his father leave on the journey to great beyond, Jaguar Paw and his fellow prisoners are bound together, and forced to trek through the jungle, abandoning the children of the village to fend for themselves.  Eventually they reach a great city, where the women are sold as slaves, and the men are forced to climb to the top of a massive ziggurat, where a sacrificial ceremony is taking place.  To appease the god Kukulkan, prisoners are held down, and their hearts are cut out.  The men are then beheaded, and their bodies flung down to crash the bottom.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is on the altar, on the verge of meeting this fate, when a solar eclipse occurs.  Taken as a sign that the deity has been satisfied, Jaguar Paw and the remaining prisoners are spared, and taken to sandy field.  In pairs, they are given a chance to run to freedom, dodging the spears and arrows of the enemy warriors.  Killing one of Zero Wolf's sons, a wounded Jaguar Paw manages to escape into the jungle, pursued by Zero Wolf and a group of warriors.  The last act of the film features Jaguar Paw in a transcendental journey, as he runs for his life, and attempts to save his family.<br /><br />In regard to sets, costumes, language, and culture, Apocalypto goes to great lengths, attempting to be realistic.  Combined with some remarkably convincing acting performances, and often brutal action scenes, and you may find yourself drawn quite deeply into this unfamiliar, and often violent world, which is very close to nature.  Apocalypto is a compelling and often shocking saga, that makes a sincere attempt to explore and pay respect to an ancient culture, while telling a poignant, tragic, and thrilling story.  There are some very rough moments, but if you persevere, you may discover a new appreciation for the simple things in life, that you might have taken for granted.
I never thought I would enjoy a movie with subtitles.  A friend of mine had asked if I had ever seen it and I hadn't. I was curious so I bought it and enjoyed it tremendously.  I got right into the movie.  After awhile I didn't realize I was reading instead of listening.  Great movie!  I would highly recommend everyone seeing it.
We just rented this movie. I didn't want to see it because I heard bad things about it, but I decided people were just angry at Mel's drunken behavior so my 18 yr old son and I watched it.<br /><br />Very good movie. Yes, it's gruesome, but this is what the Mayan kings and religious leaders did to people. They captured them, enslaved them and cut their hearts out and chopped off their heads and threw them down the bloody steps. It's in history. My son, a history buff, kept reminding me it went along with historical facts.<br /><br />I liked the native character named Jaguar Paw. Good in the midst of all that evil. Excellent ending.
Great flick with alot of action, violence and historical implications. Definitely a manly movie! I recommend it with popcorn and beer.
Wow!!  This movie has a plot, exciting, dangerous and I think very good and real.  I wonder how times were back then and this movie brings that out.  I recommend this movie.
Wonderful product. Arrived in a quick manner, item as described. Highly recommend. DVD was in in great shape, played fine. Prompt service!
This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Mel Gibson did a great job directing this movie. It grabed my attention from the very beginning and didn't let up.  I hated to see it end and it left me sad that it shows how the world is getting ready to change forever. If you are thinking about buying this movie, then do it. I don't care what kind of ass Mel Gibson is,he did a great job on this movie.
this is a most unusual story--but a great one!keeps you glued to the tv-from beginning to the end--and the blu ray version is stunning!its a  bit gory in parts but it is facinating to watch--highly enjoyable--and interesting to boot when you view the end--highly recommend
This is a great movie!  One of my all time favorites!  The transaction for this purchase was smooth, and the shopping was super fast.
The reality is that civilization triumph as depicted in this movie. Whether you want to be open minded or not, this is history. If you are a closed minded, don't watch it. Mel did a great job.
Stellar production -- One of a few I will bother to purchase having caught it this week on TV.  Not sure if credits mention or how many others have noted, but I saw some startling similarities between this and Gary Jennings' fabulous 1980 novel, "Aztec."  Bottom line is regardless your feelings for Gibson, this is a great one to see.  Very worthwhile.
I was very pleased with this purchase. It came quick, was in good condition and I liked the movie! What more can you ask for?
great movie only regret that wacth this only once you have to be open minded to appreciate this kind of work
This movie is just great. It tells the story of the end of the Mayan Civilation in an original way with hardly any speaking. Screw the Passion of the Christ, Braveheart and Hollywood for that matter. This is the best movie I have seen in years. It's one big adrenaline rush with a surprise ending. Hurray, Mel Gibson. If Hollywood had any balls, this movie would of one the Oscar for best picture of the year. It's just awesome.
It's fast-paced, well-directed and truly is a good movie.<br /><br />However, it's not for everybody. Normally, I'm not too whiny about violence in movies. But Mel Gibson went hard-core in this one, much more than his other movies. It's understandable, because it's the story of survival that happens back in savage time. It makes me feel uneasy and pushing me forward at the same time. But I wouldn't watch it again.<br /><br />If you don't mind violence, go for it. It's a crude, barbaric action that comes in a fine piece of cinema.<br />But if you can't take too much blood, violence, and tension, then it's not for you.
This movie was alot better than I expected. A lot of blood, but the first movie that showed Mayan culture in a realistic way. I was a bit apprehensive after seeing Passion Of The Christ, and I wasn't disappointed with the violence. This clearly is not a movie for kids, or the faint of heart. But it was a fantastic thrill ride that I really enjoyed watching. See this movie!
`Apocalypto' follows a mayan tribe after a group of marauders sweep in and capture village members for slaves and human sacrifices. Shot entirely in the Yucatec dialect and with subtitles, this lends some authenticity to the story and in no way detracts from the rollercoaster ride this film takes you on. There are touching scenes of family life that are quickly shattered by extreme and brutal violence and some of these scenes are quite graphic in places. The various actors play their roles superbly and Gibson's direction is as flawless as ever. Say what you will about the man, he has artistic vision if nothing else. The score is composed by James Horner and you my recognise the discordant pipe sounds also used in Braveheart at various tension filled moments in this film and the overall score is understated and spare. The colours really immerse you in this film, rich ochre's and earth tones, vivid blues of the sacrificial paint and muted jade all combine to create a palate of beauty that add a great deal to the overall feel. The story will keep you gripped for the 2  hour length and it doesn't feel anywhere near as long as this, once you connect to the characters and are in the story, you're hooked and completely engrossed. Despite the negative press around Gibson that inevitably coloured the hype around this film, this is a solidly directed and acted film and is well worth a look.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
I love this film! Saw it a few years back and decided to purchase a copy of it from Amazon. Besides the amazing setting and culture, the film pulls you in and you feel like you're a part of it. I'm a huge physics buff and this film has a lot of synchronicity and quantum mechanics in its understructure; probability and chance are a constant when you watch this movie for the first time. Most viewers are not even aware of it but this is what makes the storyline so great. You don't even need to know this, just remember that you won't be dissappointed with this purchase.
I saw the last 45 min of this movie after fliping through cable channels. I thought it was amazing and can't wait to see the entire movie.
Watched it for the first time when it came out and since it came out on blu-ray it looks amazing definitely worth the money.
The violence is a bit much and is the only reason why its not a 5 star for me.  I could hardly sit still through most of it.  It's definately high octane and loaded with suspense.  The visuals are great, wonderful directiion.  Whatever you might think of Gibson, one thing is clear: he's a wonderful filmmaker.
Note-perfect movie, video and sound.<br /><br />Mel Gibson at his very best.<br /><br />A must own.<br /><br />*****
This movie was great because it keeps you on your toes the entire time.<br /><br />The ant pinchers used as stitching was so cool!<br /><br />I wish I'd seen this movie in theatres.
Mel Gibson proved to me a few years ago that I can enjoy a movie that's not in my native language & not having that reservation this time, I was clearly able to focus on the film & this is a remarkable film.<br /><br />Against unbelievable odds, the main character, believably, takes us back to his family to keep his promise. There doesn't seem to be anything here that could NOT have happened & that makes this movie that much more valid.
This movie should've gotten way more recognition than it did. For those who didn't see it because they don't like Mel for whatever reason, your missing out on a modern day classic. Put your hate aside to enjoy a great film.
Regardless of it's historical correctness, this film is entertaining and fun to watch and gives a glimpse of what life might have been like for the people of that time and place.<br /><br />As filmmaking goes, this is quite a feat. The sets, costumes and makeup alone are worthy of an award.<br /><br />My only nitpick would be the use of the phrase "He's f**ked" in the subtitles when the one native watches the other slowly die after being bit by a snake. It's a bit much and a cheap attempt at humor in an otherwise fine film.  I don't mind the F word being used in movies, as long as it is the correct time and place, but that was really not smart on Mel's part. Totally inconsistant with the rest of the movie.
I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but was very surprised at how powerful it was. The variety of scenes from forest to rivers to "cities" was awesome. The acting was fantastic, and even though the movie was subtitled, you grew to have great affection for some of the characters. It is brutally violent in some scenes, but it is a story about survival and love. I highly recommend this movie! Like the Passion of the Christ, I keep thinking about the movie and seeing it differently every day.
Adrenaline filled rumble thru the jungles makes for an UNBELIEVEABLE Epic!!!!!!!!!<br />Suspending disbelief, After all the hero is tortured, runs for miles in thick jungle , no food, no water, outruns enemies and a very fast  panther, gets shot with a spear, shot with an arrow, is betrayed by a single drop of blood that falls when he hides in a tree [how are they able to track him so well but not get him?] jumps down a very dangerous waterfall, survives AGAINST ALL ODDS............ but after all he is our hero!<br />Its adrenaline - an exciting chase movie, shot in Mexico, which is set in ancient Maya with dialogue spoken in Yucatec Maya. Apocalypto shows MG at his best as a director /most violent, brutal and bloody. GIBSON IS AUSSIE TOUGH!!!!  For these reasons--the subject matter, subtitles, and lack of stars made it an unlikely major studio fodder. Is there more to Apocalypto than the surface story? Is this his best film of blunt provocation?<br />From a personal standpoint I usually avoid Films and violent ones especially but this one I can describe in a word......"GRIPPING!"
One of the best films ever. Mel Gibson rocks and so does this film. Sorry I waited so long to see it.
Visual, Gripping movie. Best told story of Mayans. Mel Gibson is truly an excellent director. He captured everything emotional and intense in the Mayan people. This movie makes you excited, sad, emotional, and very suspenseful. I was on the edge of my seat!
While I wouldn't call this a great movie, it is highly original and definitely has some memorable moments, including the sacrificial temple scene.  Mel does a very good job of capturing the savagery of the times, and his actors are all quite believable in their roles.  It's not an historical epic film in the sense that it only depicts the fictional story of a small group of people over a short period of time in Mayan history, rather than giving a broad overview of the decline of the Mayan civilization.  In this sense, it is similar to Mel's Passion of the Christ, which took place just over a few days or hours.  Both are highly creative and original movies.

Mad Mel's Apocalypto turns out not to be quite the splatter movie it was painted by feint-hearted critics still reeling from all the welts in The Passion. Instead it's The Naked Prey revisited with slight hints of Kings of the Sun and even Rapa Nui, though rather than telling his story from the perspective of the Mayans he chooses to play down the spectacle and see it through the eyes of their intended sacrificial victims. The story is surprisingly slight - peaceful tribe get captured as human sacrifices for Mayan priests to appease their gods, only for one to make a run for freedom and the trapped wife and child he left behind - but he manages to instil it with more substance than you might expect without hitting you over the head with it. There's an ecological message about impending disaster, but unlike any of those touchy-feely New Age types, there's no imaginary native wisdom on display here: the Mayan civilisation may be an ancient one, but here it's every bit as stupid as its modern-day equivalents, blindly destroying itself and their environment, bringing plague and devastation as they destroy their depleting natural resources, distracting the people with a non-stop conveyer belt of bloody sacrifices. These are savage times, and the film's spectacular centrepiece in the Mayan city doesn't stint on the gore. Yet at the same time the characters are recognisable - they tell dirty stories, play practical jokes and B.S. each other as they get on with their lives. Even the raiding party are little different from a group of modern-day buddies on a fishing trip.<br /><br />With Gibson beginning his film with the same Will Durant quote that ended The Fall of the Roman Empire - `a great civilisation is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within' - it's clear that he's informed by Sixties epics as more than he is by Herzog's nutters in the jungle. Indeed, while he may eschew the Scope format he even shoots the Mayan city in the classic Anthony Mann style, discarding the big establishing shot but choosing instead to gradually reveal it as the characters are drawn into it, saving the big money shots for the end of the sequence. As a result, it's a much more convincing and layered depiction of its world and its many social levels than you'd expect for something other directors might have thrown away as a simple background walk-through.<br /><br />Yet after the spectacle, the film scales itself down again as it goes back to basics, and while it's not exactly an anti-climax, it's this section that keeps the film from being more than just pretty good. The big chase lacks the imagination and power of The Naked Prey (which also has the advantage of a much tighter running time), keeping the film at the level of just another survival-of-the-smartest action adventure. It's not bad, but it doesn't hold many surprises, going through many of the traditional means of disposing of your enemies that the movies have been offering since Leslie Banks stalked The Most Dangerous Game back in 1932, though Gibson does throw in a great "There goes the neighbourhood" punchline. He's also blessed with a couple of striking villains in the Wes Studi-like form of Raoul Trujillo as the chief manhunter Zero Wolf and Gerardo Taracena as the cocky sadist of the team, Middle Eye.<br /><br />While it's certainly the best-looking digitally shot feature to date, there are still some problems - with digital's persistent problems with catching high-speed motion, it's not the best idea to shoot a chase movie in digital even if you do have a cinematographer as good as Dean Semler, and some shots are distractingly subpar even on a small screen.<br /><br />It's interesting but not entirely surprising that the not exactly overloaded with extras DVD (just a commentary, half-hour making of and 35-second deleted scene) doesn't include the film's trailer, since looking at it after seeing the film it's clearly not only made up of footage that doesn't even appear in the film - mainly makeup, wardrobe and camera test footage - but it even seems to include a different leading man and a very different look for its native characters and even the Mayan city.
I had my doubts about seeing this movie because I had heard it was so bloody and violent, but after watching it, I am glad I did. Many other reviewers have described the movie, so I won't bore you with that, I'll just offer some general impressions.<br /><br />The opening scenes are designed, I think, to engage the sympathy of the viewer for the forest tribe.  While it might be difficult for many people to feel sympathy for pre-Colombian natives who are violent and even savage, I think Gibson did a good job on this part.  We accompany the men on a hunt, see that they engage in typical "male bonding" behavior, see that they have mother-in-law problems, love and cherish their children, and so on.<br /><br />More than that, during the hunting scene, we see something else: a warning given that was ignored, shoved under the rug. Had that warning of fear been heeded, preparations made to resist the impending terror, there might have been less destruction.  That's a good object lesson for us even today.<br /><br />The scenes of the Mayan city were especially helpful to me.  I have been to Mexico and have studied Mayan ruins first hand.  They left me feeling very disturbed; I could NOT imagine what kind of culture would create such savage and even ugly art.  I don't mean ugly in the sense that it was badly done, not that at all.  But the "soul" revealed in Mayan art is truly horrifying.<br /><br />Mel Gibson gave this art a background for me that finally helped me to make sense of it.<br /><br />I noticed something else: all the savagery, body pierciings, horrible and ugly hairdos of the women, and the general behavior of the culture reminded me of U.S. society over the past 10 years or so.  I know that seems a bit over-the-top, but I have never been able to understand why attractive people would go so far out of their way to make themselves ugly with hair that looks like its been cut with a dull lawnmower, body piercings, wearing clothes that look like slave gear or rejects from a concentration camp, and so on.  It's just bizarre.  (And I won't even go into what passes as art these days, much less music!)<br /><br />When you take those things in the context of what has happened to the U.S. since 9-11, and you compare it to the society depicted in this movie, there are unnerving parallels.  I even think that Gibson intended the movie to reflect the U.S. in it's decline.  At the beginning of the movie, he quotes Ariel Durant who wrote:<br /><br />"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."<br /><br />As the movie came to the end, I was glad that Gibson didn't use it as a cheesy add for his religious agenda...<br /><br />It was beautifully photographed, with fantastic sets and I have to say that the violence was not gratuitous: that's just how things were then and to have made the movie otherwise would have been cheating.<br /><br />Well worth watching; I'm glad I did.
This is an outstanding, beautiful epic movie. I have watched it again and again. I am grateful Mel Gibson has the ability and resources to recreate an amazing view of an historical situation and depict a strong, innocent, good hero.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NQQ4ME">Mel Gibson's Apocalypto [Blu-ray</a>
Everything in this film is brilliant; the acting, directing, writing, sets, cinematography--everything! It has been so long since so much human emotion has been conveyed with such realism as in this work of art.<br /><br />No, films are NOT about being "historically accurate." To those critics I say, "Write your own book." And after you do, get a life.<br /><br />Mel Gibson has out done himself here. Add another gem to his filmography.<br /><br />Ridley Scott needs to dust off his cameras and rise to the challenge layed down here, because Mel Gibson has moved into his category of directors.
Wow.  Captivating as this film was, I could have watched it with no translation of the dialogue and I still would have known everything that was happening.  Such was the power of collective consciousness that it conveyed, however incongruent to history it may be.  The cinematography is beautiful and the hunter vs hunted plot engaging.  Calling on primal triggers and survivalistic instinct is at the core of the success of this film.  Yes, the costumes, jungle settings, buttocks, breasts, and "cultural" details are enthralling.  It is the power of tapping into collective memory and how we have formed our view of ancient heritage that is so astounding.  Is it very accurate?  Are the scenarios presented very likely?  I don't know.  Would anyone know?  Does it matter?  I was intensely curious about the language that was spoken and intend to do some more reading around that.  Given that, the film was provocative enough to make me dig deeper into understanding Mayan culture.
This movie is something more of what I expected because of the reviews I have read before regarding the gore in it. Well, to me, this movie is not about the gore (like other movies such as Grindhouse) but about some specifics of the Mayan culture which happened to behave that way traditionally, a story about a family and their struggle trying to survive. This movie made me care for the characters and kept me in tension its entire time, and only good directors can make the audience feel this way.<br /><br />For some reason, this movie also made me recall other great 80 films such as "First Blood" (Rambo I), "Indiana Jones I and II", "Predator" and even "Commando" because of the "I let him go" one liner. If you have seen all these movies, you'll understand what I'm talking about when you see "Apocalypto"; perhaps Mel Gibson sub-consciously though of these great 80 flicks while making this Mayan film.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for a mature - non sensitive audience.<br /><br />PS: Perhaps this movie has a little bit of "Conan the Barbarian" too.
The opening shot of Apocalypto is a nod and a wink to Coppola's opening gambit of Apocalypse Now: Coppola began with a silent shot of a tree line, broken only by the whirr of a helicopter as it passes through the frame. Gibson has the same, but substitutes the helicopter for a man racing across the screen in pursuit of a tapir. Gibson's new film has a lot in common with Coppola's, but Mel makes it even harder for the viewer to watch: his movie is in the ancient Mayan language. The director takes his sweet time shooting endless-but-beautiful shots of vegetation and, like the movies of those two auteurs, Apocalypto's plot is small, but everything surrounding it is on a massive, grandiose scale. The story follows Jaguar Paw (Youngblood), a hunter living a happy life deep in the jungle. After a warring tribe decimates his village and drags him back to their city to be offered to the Mayan gods as a sacrifice, he escapes and takes the fight to his captors. With Gibson's recent blatant Christian motives, Apocalypto's Christ allegories are thankfully kept to a minimum; but religion and its influence on civilization do play a massive part throughout. An epic - despite the severed heads, the torture, rape and brutal killings - hasn't looked this beautiful since Lawrence Of Arabia, while Youngblood, for an unknown, carries the film firmly on his shoulders.
This movie looks fantastic, has great characters, and has many cool parts that you will enjoy watching over and over again. As for the detractors, in the beginning scene they trick one of their friends into eating boar testicles to enhance his virility, and all have a laugh at his gullibility. If you turned the movie off at that point you shouldn't be posting a review, because you've only revealed your close-mindedness and no legitimate opinion. As for its historical accuracy, southern Maya cities were abandoned circa 9th century, but "during the succeeding post-classic period (from the 10th to the early 16th century), development in the northern centers persisted, characterized by an increasing diversity of external influences. The Maya cities of the northern lowlands in Yucat&aacute;n continued to flourish for centuries more." Mel Gibson is a bigot, not an idiot.
Outstanding action adventure that is totally gripping whether you read the subtitles or not. Yeah its bloody at times but its not nearly as bloody as some would have you believe. Probably not historically acurate but I kind of doubt that was the director's sole intention. Excellent special feature documentary and amusing fact-filled commentary.
Mel Gibson does a Mayan take on Cornell Wilde's classic "Naked Prey". There's also homage to "Mad Max 3" in a Mayan form of "Bartertown" though sadly minus Tina Turner as Aunty Entitity. A couple of shots out of the "killing fields" are also included. It's not a patch on Cornel Wilde's original great masterpiece but still a fantastic movie.
Fantastic movie, so great looking in 1080p, but very short on features.  I assumed with it being blu ray the extras would be great, but nothing like my hd dvd's.
The movie is very intrigue and realistic of a time not talked about.  The action and storyline is tremendous and thought provoking and graphic. Definetly not for the young at heart.
This movie is fantastic.  Do not read too many of the reviews because they seem to give away too much of the plot.  Yes it is violent, but done well.  Hats off to Mel and his crew for making a great film with no spoken english, yet very easy to follow and even easier to get wrapped up in.  I did not want it to end.
Not the best from Mel Gibson but still a worthy effort. Be prepared for some violence. The first part of the film has a dream like quality to it and then the chase begins. The cinematography is grade A and should've won an oscar. The sound and picture of the blu ray is pristine and this film is great eye candy. If you like action and heart, this movie delivers on both aspects!!! The story of a man who's trying to save his family.
Great movie, the speaking of the mayan dialect doesnt detract from this movie at all.<br /><br />Mel may be a drunk, jew bashing sob. But man can he make a movie. I went into this movie thinking I wouldnt like it but was throughly suprised by it. Its a true classic.<br /><br />If you liked his previous work and your looking for a movie with a southamerican motif you cant go wrong,<br /><br />Also I didnt think this movie was as gory as everyone proclaimed it to be.
I like the story told, and the film itself is very color rich. Great blu-ray transfer is done on both video, and audio.  If you like the typical Mel Gibson movie, you will enjoy this one even though it is not in English.
Feel like living in the Maya world, though fictional, story is touching and real, great on blu-ray format.
Went into this movie blind, knew nothing about it, never read a review, I just bought it because I wanted to increase my blu ray library and may I say its has become one of my favourite movies I own. The picture and sound quality is up there with the best blu ray has to offer and as for the movie itself its a fantastic story that draws you in with lighthearted humor at the beginning then turns to an edge of your seat experience showcasing the brutality of ancient civilizations. One word of warning is that the entire film is in the mayan language with english subtitles.It didn't bother me and to be honest i was so into the story i didnt even notice it but if you cant be bothered reading something once in a while you might find it hard to follow the story.
Interesting movie. Great visuals. Captions not at all distracting. Good to show off HDTV. Great ending.
That Movie gives you a New Experience in watching a Movie. Soon this Move brings you to a never seen before World. Everything seems to be real as you watching the Movie. Sound and Picture are how Blu-Ray should be...<br />Take the Trip....<br />But beware, if you don't like Movie's in Original Language(Maya) with English Subtitel...but give this Movie a try
Absolutely pristine video transfer and audio transfers make this a reference BD title.<br /><br />I was not sure if I wanted to see this movie due to it being in Mayan dialogue with english subtitles. However as strange as this may sound I actually understood most of what was being said with only minor glances at the subtitling. Truely an awesome movie, if you want to see a Mayan Rambo then check this movie out.<br /><br />May I just add that anyone who has put off seeing this movie because of Mel Gibson then I would respectfully suggest that in this instance you are doing yourself an injustice. I am sure Mel had a hand in this film but in all honesty after watching the extras on the disc I think even Mel would acknowledge that there were many, many people who made this film what it is. This truely is a masterpiece when it comes to engaging a predominantly english speaking audience into a non english speaking movie.<br /><br />I had a couple of friends over tonight to watch it, knowing full well that they are both very anti Mel. They watched the movie and were blown away by it to be honest, the comment that I thought was interesting was when they said that they had deliberately not watched it due to Mel's involvement. However, they thanked me for putting it on as they thought it was a wonderful movie and very thought provoking for them with their beliefs.
Just watched this movie on standard def DVD -  didnt know if i was going to like it at first but after 20 minutes in- I was TOTALLY HOOKED!!!!!!!!  I cant wait to see it on Blu-Ray!  Im buying this tonight!
One of the best looking and sounding Blu-ray discs on the market. It's also a fantastic movie in it's own right. Good stuff.
This a fantastic movie!  The scenery is great and the characters very interesting.  I wonder if the trauma that the characters go thru is anything like the slave trade in africa or any place in the world.<br /><br />The one thing I would like is to have the movie dubbed in English.  I know it is more authentic in its native 'aztec' language, but I think I may have missed a few things by reading the subtitles.
What an awesome movie. Not recommended for those with weak stomachs. Jaguar Paw makes two crucial mistakes after the raid; he draws attention to his father and dad is killed. He draws attention to the well he hid his pregnant wife and child in by not moving the dead mayans body away from the well and mayan who has it in for him cuts the rope when he finds it. He (Jaguar) is sinking inside as he's lead away and watches the cut rope dissapear into the well. These two mistakes stunned me but thats the breaks. Did this movie remind anyone of "The Pianist"? This one is also a must see.
I have read most of the reviews and I can understand why someone would give this movie a 1 star and complain about all the violence in this picture. But you see, one most understand the movie one's looking at. This is a movie about one of the most violent, savage culture ever to be on the Americas - Just an aside - It is hard to believe  but there was another american culture even worse, the Aztec, I know that some people idiolize this culture today but some of the pictures from their own culture shows people buying human legs hanging in a store like cow legs are shown in a modern market today.<br /><br />...I'm sorry. Back to the movie "Apocalypto" It is a masterpiece and a unique movie that keep you glued to the screen for the entire duration of the movie. Isn't this what we are looking for in a movie anyway?<br /><br />Kudos to Mel Gibson and please, please keep making movies like this, please!
I saw this movie 3 times and I'm going to get it when comes out on dvd. Braveheart had more violence than this epic. My problem are the critics. You all are nothing but a bunch of hypocrites. First off there was nothing Anti-Indian about this film and I am very pro Indian. Second for all those people who attack Mel Gibson for historical inaccuracy, where were you ding bats, when 300 came out. I found more historical inaccuracy and violence in that movie than in Apocalypto. Plus is just me, or are the same people who accused Mel Gibson of putting too much violence in his movies, praising movies like Kill Bill, Natural Born Killers and Sin City? Plus, you want to talk about racism, how come all the bad guys in 300 were black? Get my point? Hypocrisy!! Leave Mel Gibson alone. Stop criticising this movie. It was a great movie, with only Native actors whose performance I give an A+. I hope Mel Gibson does some more movies with American Indian actors. I got some books that I'm reading that he should turn into movies.
I was totally blown away by this film's lush setting, tragic characters, and vividly bloody scenes.<br /><br />My favorite character was the man assumed to be infertile. I felt sorry for him as the others made fun of him, as his mother-in-law repeatedly told him that he was worthless. And then later on, his separation with his mother-in-law was so touching. I found it intriguing that their society blamed the man for infertility - in most cases, it seems, the woman is blamed if she "fails" to produce a child.<br /><br />But anyway, to me, the strongest part of the movie was as Jaguar Paw, about to be sacrificed atop the temple, was spared. The obese, "upper class" young boy who giggled and pulled at his mother's dress in impatience perfectly depicted how torture is entertainment for the entitled (although the masses obviously enjoyed it as well). And I'm not ashamed to admit that I liked seeing all the violence as much as any of the masses. The violence here was so shocking, so striking, and the images stay with you for awhile. But who would go to see a movie like this and expect only happy, peaceful activities? Peace, though ideal in real life, is rather dull and does not bring viewers to a movie. And peace is, after all, usually achieved through violent war. And what is the ultimate peace? Death.<br /><br />I wanted to see this movie mostly because I wanted to see how violent it really was, how far Gibson would go. Indeed, he went far enough, and made a good point. Critics who dismiss this movie over the violence just don't get it. Yeah, so it was really violent, but it needs to be violent in order to get people's attention. People are evil and there is much pointless killing and hatred in this world. (Humans are not inherently "good" as some may believe.)<br /><br />The beginning quote about civilizations being destroyed only if they destroy themselves from within first seems to be true. Many people would completely blame the Europeans for the demise of the tribes - but if the Mayans hadn't started killing off each other first, there might have been enough manpower to overthrow the Europeans, especially if they were united. That's just a theory, of course. If you see this movie, you'll be pleasantly (or rather unpleasantly) surprised by how strongly it takes hold of you.
As more than one commentator has noted, in terms of plot APOCALYPTO seems to draw from the 1966 THE NAKED PREY, the 1932 THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, and the numerous films both have influenced over the years.  In this particular instance the story focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), whose presumably peaceful village is destroyed by Mayans intent upon obtaining human sacrifice to appease their bloodthirty gods.  After a harrowing march to the Mayan city, Jaguar Paw escapes death--and the city, with a furious party of Myan warriors in hot pursuit.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, there is considerable bleed-over from Mel Gibson's 2004 THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST into the 2006 APOCALYPTO.  The two have often been compared in terms of violence, but the connection goes quite a bit deeper this; it is imbedded in the subtext of the film itself.  A forced march while tied to long poles; a prayer uttered by a woman that sounds suspiciously like a Mayan-language Hail Mary; a prophesy that warns about a man "reborn from mud and earth" who will "end your world;" and enough arrow and javelin wounds to slay Saint Sebastian himself several times over.  The ending is a bit of a quandary, certainly more open to interpretation than that of THE PASSION--but striking the same tone and tying all the subtextual imagery directly to the Roman Catholic Church.  And we need hardly mention the title of the film itself, a reference to the vision of St. John the Divine.<br /><br />It is also worth noting that, like THE PASSION, APOCALYPTO has a none too subtle point: the Mayans, at least as Gibson presents them (the film is riddled with historical inaccuracy, but I'll leave that argument to the scholars), are a corrupt society en route to self-destruction: they have stripped the land of its resources and their civilization has become unsustainable.  Given Gibson's own well-known religious sentiments, there is a certain irony in that the Mayans are driven into this by blindly-followed religious motives.  In any case, we are clearly intended to read the overall film as commentary of sorts on contemporary society's rape of the planet.<br /><br />Although I would give the dubious prize of "most violent" to THE PASSION, there is plenty to go around in APOCALYPTO--and, as in THE PASSION, it is not always of a viable nature.  I find it hard to believe that Jaguar Paw's tribe hunted with the horrifically lethal trap shown here; the Mayans were not as blood-thirsty as portrayed here (Gibson seems to have confused them with the Aztecs), and lot many of the rituals, weapons, and the game of "run for your life" itself, are highly speculative at best.  Even so, I cannot actually say that the violence or its graphic nature are implausible within the context of the film.<br /><br />What IS completely implausible is the amount of physical damage Jaguar Paw sustains without being mortally wounded.  He is dragged along in bondage, half hung by accident, escapes sacrifice by a fraction of a second, is shot through with an arrow, and all the rest--but like the old Timex Watch slogan, he takes a licking and keeps on ticking, seeming to run without pause for forty-eight hours, vaulting down a waterfall, and even getting clipped a time or two more, most often with scarcely a pause to wince.  But Gibson is fair about it: he endows Jaguar Paw's pursuers with the same absurdly improbable endurance and strength.<br /><br />Although it has its flaws--and what film doesn't?--the truly great thing about APOCALYPTO is the technical brilliance and artistic eye that Gibson and his team bring to the project.  It's visually dazzling, and Gibson and cinematographer Dean Semler have knack for selecting one knock-out camera set up after another.  Everything from cast to costumes is truly amazing, and the film moves with tremendous speed.  One thing it isn't is dull.<br /><br />But it is extremely troubling.  In addition to THE PASSION, one might also compare it to the notorious 1979 CALIGULA, a film which so mingled sex and violence that both could be considered equally pornographic.  Although there's no visual sex at all--it is a subject Gibson tends to shy away from--APOCALYPTO has much the same effect.  The violence is essentially pornographic in nature, teasing us, leading us on to increasingly intense climaxes of blood and gore.  One has to wonder at the motives here, particularly when the producer-director-writer is so clearly trying to make a "save the world" statement; it seems to me that Gibson's visions are less a solution than part of the problem itself--and doesn't mind, as many scholars have noted, twisting historical fact in the process.  It would seem that Gibson is determined to have a personal marytdom by cinematic proxy.  It's all very problematic.<br /><br />The DVD quality is very fine and offers a commentary track by Gibson, et al and a making-of featurette.  Three stars for technical brilliance.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
Enough of the details are accurate enough to make this  a most wonderful excursion into the mists of the  Pre Columbian past.  Add to that  superb photography and acting, a tour de force of production.<br /><br />Folks:  It don't get any better!!!
Overall a good movie that keeps your attention pretty much for the duration. The jungle scenes and chases are great and well filmed. On that basis alone I would rate it as 4 stars.  However, I deduct one star as Gibson seems to relish the protracted use of violence and gore; one heart removal on the sacrificial bench is not enough, Gibson requires you to watch two. When a Mayan is attacked by a panther, a swift death is insufficient, you need to see his face being stretched and ripped off by the black cat.<br /><br />Don't expect to learn a lot about Mayan culture. You will learn nothing of the intelligence of the Mayan civilization - their knowledge of mathematics, calendar, astronomy - instead you have the impression that they are nothing more than a tribe of savages as the only part of Mayan life that Gibson cares to show us is human sacrifice.<br /><br />Overall, pretty good entertainment and great quality blu-ray, stained only by too much gore and a misleading portrayal of Mayan culture.
Mayan hunters run through the jungle after a tapir-dinner. The animal finally meets it's bloody demise in a trap which they had set beforehand. Then our brave boys have a little fun with "organ meat" before returning to their wives and families in their peaceful, relatively primitive village.  Foreign Mayans from a brutal, relatively advanced urban area arrive on scene, ravage the hut-dwelling tribe, and take a few men prisoner, so that they can have their hearts ripped out, too. (You gotta make a few sacrifices when you live in the big city, you know.)<br /><br /> Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is freed from the altar because the sun eclipses, then he and the remaining prisoners--a "blue-man group", only without the instruments--are subjected to a game of "you run to freedom, whilst we throw sharp instruments at you."  Jaguar Paw manages to get only "a little impaled"  (only a flesh wound), and the rest of the movie he's gotta run through the jungle in order to escape his pursuers  and rescue his wife and young son from the deep well where he has hidden them.  If he can.<br /><br />There's a lot of pretty scenery--lush greenery, wonderful water falls--but the society is rotting to the core, and thus on the brink of downfall, apocalypse. O.  En route to the city, the captive and captors are met by a young girl with skin lesions.  The Man pushes her repeatedly away with a stick, not wanting to get infected with her sickness-unto-death.  The rejected child staunchly warns them of their future doom by similar illness.  (this kid, a native who only speaks Mayan, is great in this role BTW).  Later, they reject a sick old skeletal dude, on their way to appease the gods.  Well, these presumably serve to foreshadow the deadly illness that will be brought on by the Spaniards whose tall ships come in for a landing in the last scene.<br /><br />Not only do they neglect the ill and slaughter the healthy, but they ravage the land itself in pursuit of their advanced civilization.  Weakened within, their society is rife for conquest from without; thus proving the Will Durant quote at the opening, "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within".<br /><br />Well done!
This is a great movie and was totally boycotted by racist Hollywood media moguls.  It should have won an oscar.  I bought two copies to support Mel Gibson and his works of art and to stick it to hollywood execs.
If you only have time to watch one movie this week, this one should be your choice! This is an extraordinary tale that churns with love, fear and the fight to survive. Based on historic civilizations, it takes us through the journey of an Indian (Rudy Youngblood) captured from his peaceful tribe and taken with his friends to the brutal Kingdom of the Mayans where they are to be sacrificed. But sometimes love is stronger than hate, and Jaguar Paw puts his terror aside to get back to his pregnant wife and child hidden in an empty well in his village. Will he reach her before it rains and the dry well floods? There is scene after scene of great action and acting (too many to count). Gibson and Farhad Safinia are an excellent team and have made a very powerful film!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
This movie was fantastic, the visual displays are breathtaking, the mayan warriors chasing jaguar paw with torches in the night, the waterfall taunt, the displays of the jungle.<br /><br />i see a lot of reviewers out there claiming that this movie is somehow innacurate, those claims are based on mayan sterotypes. First, this movie takes place in post-classic maya, cities like chichenitza, uxmal and mayapan are the prototype of this movie's city, which DID have alot of valley of mexico civs influence. Mayan states in the classic and post classic did sacrifce war capitves first by removal of heart and then by decapitation, (see Schele & Mathews, Gann & Thompson) all the events of the sacrificing were accurate even down to the warrior chief's human jaw bones on his arm from his previous captive/sacrifices. More and more archaeological evidence is showing that the mayans were as sacrificial cult oriented as the Aztecs. All Gibson does is take what was perhaps a little bit rare and portray it in the movie.<br /><br />Second, the mayans were great astronomers, which is exactly why Gibson makes it obvious that the ruling elites in the film knew what was going on, they were simply afraid of their desperate subjects situation and needed to maintain belief in their own legitimacy.<br /><br />Third, many reviewers have claimed that gibson shows that the mayans needed saving from their barbarity by the spaniards. His real image was to show that the mayans were brutal, but withing the context of their societal norms. you didnt see the sacrifical priests or the warrior captain enjoying their killings, they were doing it as what they believed necessary to maintain their order. Contrast that with the spaniards vividly portrayed in de las Casas and Broken Spears who not only were equally barbarous as the Mayans, but also gleefully enjoyed their cruelty in the pursuit of gold and riches more often than not!<br /><br />All in all i think this movie is the best one in years, gibson's imagery and messages are subtle but unmistakable, and as one reviewer stated, the movie does need some afterthought particularly with focus on facial expressions of the characters.<br /><br />In addition, not all mayan states were completely "lost" when the spaniards arrived, many kingdoms, although not in their former glory, had begun to regrow, such as in tulum, coba, peten itza and q'iche, so this movie is not a far strech, perhaps he delayed some characteristics of urban maya ~100 yrs to ~1511 when the first documented spaniard arrived. it is not a stretch to imagine that small pox would have reached the maya prior to the actual arrival of the spanish due to their numerous regional exploits, (4th columbus, grijalva exped.) and then spread through mesoamerican trade. I even interpreted the refugees saying "our lands were ravaged" in the beginning as having been because of spaniards, such as they did in the grijalva expedition and the ones that shiprecked geronimo aguilar.<br /><br />acting is impeccable<br /><br />Simply put, well done Gibson, well done!
Hide the children and the faint-hearted! APOCALYPTO is the most harrowing, viscerally violent film I've seen outside of several Italian exploitation flicks and that opening sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. APOCALYPTO is an epic movie which narrates the savage adventures of a young hunter, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), in the waning age of the Mayan civilization - it tells of the disruption of Jaguar Paw and his fellow villagers' simple existence as they are captured by an invasive war party and of Jaguar Paw's torturous journey back to his pregnant young wife and son as his captors mercilessly go on the chase.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO was strenuously filmed in the Mexican state of Veracruz and the rainforests of Catemaco; director Mel Gibson was conscientious about hiring a cast comprised entirely of native actors and, much like in the ambitious use of Aramaic in PASSION OF THE CHRIST, having them speak in Yucatec Maya (with English sub-titles), thus lending immense credibility and authenticity to the picture. The glory and savagery of the Mayan culture are in full depiction here as we are treated to majestic temples and pyramids rising up in cinematic grandeur, followed by intense, gory scenes of unhinged violence and vicious sacrifices (decapitations, eviscerations, bodies being pierced, and, in one brutal moment, a face being bit off by a jaguar - *yech*).<br /><br />Tinged with prophecy and doom and resplendent with truly spectacular cinematography, APOCALYPTO is also well served by the acting performances of the unknown cast. A standout, of course, is pow-wow singer and artist Rudy Youngblood, who  makes his acting debut here and boldly carries the film. Dalia Hernandez (Seven, Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife) also acts for the first time and acquits herself well. Raoul Trujillo, on the other hand, is an experienced actor who is appropriately fearsome as the leader of the Holcane warriors, Zero Wolf.<br /><br />The fully realized APOCALYPTO is guaranteed to transport the viewer back hundreds of years to an ancient culture, of which downfall has been cloaked in mystery and conjecture. It's quite an experience. Mel Gibson dips his hand once again in riveting myth-making. The first half of the film is punctuated by awesome world-building as Gibson delves into the Mayan culture, with particular emphasis on the ruling priesthood who insist that more and yet more sacrifices will stave off doom to their declining way of life. The last half of the movie, however, does devolve into basically an extended chase sequence, however harrowing and thrilling. That Jaguar Paw can sure take a licking.<br /><br />This film may be too intense and graphic for some viewers. Several of my friends thought APOCALYPTO too gratuitous in its violence but I feel that the graphic nature was required to drive Gibson's particular vision home. Else, this probably would've been reduced to being a watered-down cultural film. Think what you will of Mel Gibson, he is a great filmmaker who will not stint on his cinematic visions. And, in that purview, I do respect him. APOCALYPTO is unrelentingly violent, thought-provoking, dream-like at times, and truly majestic. And, for my money, it's a near-masterpiece.
Excellent movie, great to see something different, new faces and so far removed from the usual Hollywood sausage machine of same same same....<br />The subtitles worked, its curious how you get used to that but is was fine.<br />Storyline kept me dialled in, scenery excellent and a movie one would remember for a long time. If you haven't seen this film, you should.
this is what cinema is made for.Mel gibson did something great and it is not a real surprise.This is a must have in a dvd collection.<br />The beginning is a bit slow but for the rest fasten seat belt...<br />We wish more films like that
Mel Gibson is a real artist.  This movie is a work of art.  Every thing about it - from A to Z, actors to zoology, is pure art.  The movie no sooner starts when you're plunged into its fast paced drama.  Like Road Warrior it shows the story instead of telling it, what the medium thrives on, without losing you in a lot of meaningless dialogue (Deadwood comes to mind).  As a Native American (Spirit Lake Dakota Nation), I feel that it is the best movie yet that depicts the beauty, power. and compassion of Native people of the Americas.
Some people will love this, some people hate it. I'm sure the subtitles will turn a lot of people off, but for those that do get turned off (and in fact turn it off) are missing out on a fantastic, visually stunning and masterfully directed epic. Not quite as masterful as Braveheart and I never did see Passion of the Christ, but Apocalypto is story telling at it's best. Great characters and wonderfully acted, extreme bloody action and certainly not for the squeamish. Brilliant!
Being a historian, and living in Honduras for almost a decade teaching history at the university level, I have to say that Gibson shattered the noble savage myth of pre-Colombian civilizations. The cultural foundation of these post-Hispanic nations is very anti-Spaniard, and based on the anti-Spanish Black Legend, as well as Marxist materialism. So when I went to see Apocalypto, I was not disappointed at the presentation of pre-Colombian America. Actually, it was more cruel, goryer, and more macabre than what Gibson portrayed! He was very mild.<br /><br />  When the Spaniards came, there was the question whether the inhabitants were actually human and rather demons, for what they saw and experienced went betond the realm of the worst imagination. The cruelty of the conquest stems from this source, which was settled during the Sepulveda/Las Casas debates, where it was acknowledged that Indians were not demons or demonic but human beings in need of salvation and conversion to Catholicism.<br /><br />  Gibson's film is not a historical film, and not a PC one either (that is evident, thank God)but shows, to the best of his directorial ability,  a historical period for what it was -- civilizations that were in a moral decline beyond repair at the arrival of the Spaniards. Mexicans and Latin American marxists and materialists can scream and shout, but the truth hurts.
Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" glimpses into the past and provides us a telling commentary on the present. It's a visually stunning adventure epic that even has a message at its core (although Gibson doesn't beat us over the head with it). Jaguar Paw and his people are attacked and kidnapped to be used as sacrifices for the Mayan gods. It seems that as they have strip mined their own land to build greater temples, they've also caused famine, disease and death to take hold as well. Paw must escape to save his pregnant wife and son who were left behind and are hiding before it is too late.<br /><br />The second half of the film reminded me quite a bit of both Cornell Wilde's "The Naked Prey" and "The Most Dangerous Game" with its cat and mouse chase through the rain forest as Janguar Paw is pursued after he escapes. You should be aware that the film is in ancient Mayan with English, Spanish and French subtitles. The film received an "R" rating for violence probably deserved given the graphic nature of the first half and last third of the film.<br /><br />The film provides an interesting parallel for our modern world; the Mayans (like today) end up destroying much of their world in pursuit of building larger monuments to their greatness and living out their fantasy as the pinnacle of modern civilization. The result is famine, deforestation, disease and death.<br /><br />The sharp direction, performances, cinematography and music allows the viewer to overlook some of the minor flaws of the film such as the simple story.  He also clearly has an innate sense for the power of cinema--the image and he lets the image carry the story knowing, in a sense, that it makes up for the weaknesses of the story itself. Gibson's ecological parable has a corker of an ending that comes totally out of left field (in fact Gibson in his commentary states that the film was originally build around this conclusion which was meant as something of a joke. Surprisingly, that conclusion works very well indeed).<br /><br />The DVD looks and sounds stunning. While the extras are somewhat meager (only a short documentary on the making of the film, a deleted scene and a commentary track by co-writer/director/co-producer Gibson with co-writer/co-producer Farhad Safinia)they aren't fluff. The documentary shows the challenge that Gibson and his crew faced in building many of the massive sets, providing make up for a large group of people and working largely with non-actors.<br /><br />Hopefully a deluxe edition will be in the pipeline at some point with some historical featurettes/documentaries. While the film isn't 100% historical accurate, Gibson uses the trappings well and incorporates as much as he can into the film to give it a feeling of "reality". This is a well made, visually stunning film that deserved a far better outcome at the box office.<br /><br />Sure, this film is a variation on the noble savage theme again but Gibson does such a marvelous job with the material that I'm willing to overlook the cliches of the story itself. Gibson doesn't get preachy in his message but just lays it out there while allowing his film to do the speaking for him.
An Aztec civilization would have been a better backdrop for a  historically accurate movie, but details aside, Mel created another masterpiece. This movie is more than just entertainment. It comes with a very thought-provoking message: Conquering nations will commit the most hideous crimes to remain in power and the cycle continues to repeat itself as weaker nations fall to the ones with the biggest and meanest guns. Fabulously breathtaking and totally awesome (and I mean the literal awe-inspiring kind!)

Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" is a very well-made film set during the final days of the Mayan empire. The cast and crew do a fine job of bringing the Mayan world to life. The second half of the film is a little long and drawn out but the final hour of the movie is truly exciting. Leading up to the ending will leave everyone breathless. Fans of Gibson's previous epic films will enjoy "Apocalypto."
I just saw Apocalypto based on the recommendations of some friends at work and I found it highly entertaining.  Without giving out any spoilers, I felt the movie was well acted(especially Youngblood), well imagined visually and action packed. The only negative thing I can say was that it was too short. I think the movie was much more than simply an action movie. The scenes in the village were excellent and I wanted to see more of them, likewise I wished the ending was more balanced out.<br /><br />Rating B+/A-<br /><br />p.s I'm Jewish and I think Mel Gibson is an EXCELLENT filmmaker who just gets a little kooky after a few drinks.
Truly a very original and creative movie that moves at a relentless, breakneck pace.  Contrary to many reviews here, the garb, customs depicted in the movie are very close to original.  Great direction, photography and surprisingly good acting by unknown actors.  Great movie!
The Amazon "Plot Synopsis" above asserts that this film should only be watched "by people who enjoy exaggerations of history," but the only thing that Mel Gibson is guilty of, with regards to historical accuracy, is a blurring of Mayan and Aztec cultures. It was the Aztecs, not the Mayans, who were kidnapping, enslaving and sacrificing minority tribesmen in the years before the Spanish conquest. The Mayans sacrificed humans too, but, although there are still millions of people who speak Mayan dialects in Central America to this day, their civilization collapsed about six hundred years before the arrival of Cortez.<br /><br />The human sacrifices that are depicted in Apocalypto are not an "exaggeration" of history. The law of the Aztec Empire, for example, mandated a thousand human sacrifices to the god Huitzilopchtli in every town with a temple, every year. The largest mass sacrifice that was documented by the Aztecs themselves occured in 1487, just a few years before the arrival of the Europeans: On the occasion of the dedication of the immense Temple of Huitzilopochtli in Tenochtitlan (what is now Mexico City), eighty-thousand men were killed over a four-day, four-night period. By all accounts, sacrifice victims had their "heart torn out while still beating and held up for all to see," and their "body was kicked over the edge of the temple platform where it bounced and slithered...down the steps." The only detail that Mel Gibson leaves out is the cannibalism.<br /><br />But Apocalypto is about a lot more than the slavery and genocide that preceded the European conquest. It is an action adventure thriller like no other.<br /><br />When a Central American village is raided for slaves and sacrifice victims by Mayans, one of the villagers, Jaguar Paw, hides his pregnant wife and child in a deep hole in the ground. Jaguar Paw must then escape from his captors and return to save his wife and children before they die from exposure and starvation.<br /><br />Mel Gibson usually makes great movies, but he really outdid himself with this one. Apocalypto is his geatest film to date. It is sad that many will miss this film because of the unfortunate drunk driving incident. Many are intent to boycott Mr. Gibson, and, in a free country, we should be free to watch or not watch movies for any reason we choose. But if you don't watch this one, for any reason, you're really missing one of the most affecting and exhilarating films of all time.
I have been wracking my brains  to think about a movie which has made more of an impression on me other then Apocalypto in the last 10 years  but I can't think of a  worthy candidate (well Minority Report comes a distant 2nd) .<br /><br />Apocalypto  OWNS on many levels . Action , adventure, suspense , costume design, makeup , story , setting , novelty , depth of acting , screenplay and in many other aspects too long to mention  here . So one would think at least a NOMINATION for the any of the Oscars for that year eh ?  Nope . Not a mention<br /><br />The first thing that strikes you about Apocalypto is the incredible  Mayan  gear , something I have  never seen before in any movie  , the fabulous  makeup on the thousands of extras , the whole thing  seemlessly  blending into the Yucatan jungle  . Everything effortlessly clicks . One would think then at LEAST an OSCAR NOD for the painstaking work put into the costumes  and makeup not to mention the originality of the work  ?<br /><br />Nope<br /><br />Costume design Oscar  winner for that year ? Marie Antoinette .Sheesh.. How hard is it to put together a 17th century Versailles wardrobe again  ? Pull out a  few rags from the some recent  BBC costume drama then score  some 80's disco music with that. Oscar guaranteed it seems  .<br /><br />Makeup Oscar winner for that year ? Pan's Labyrinth. Never heard of it .<br /><br />Best Picture for that year ? In fact which movie carried off about the most  oscars for that year?  "The Departed" .  A ridiculous foul mouthed  flick I switched off about half an hour before its ending. Not that I'm offended by bad language you understand but this one practically  wore out  the f* word  . That and the fact that the plot was absurd and the acting over the top (especially DiCaprio).<br /><br />OTOH half an hour before the ending of Apocalypto I was glued to my seat because I WAS IN APCALYPTO ,  right there with Jaguar Paw running for  dear life , chased through  the Jungle by the evil doers thinking about that family deep down in that pit where I left them .<br /><br /> That's  the  essence of moviemaking , that's what its all about ,  the moviegoer transported , overwhelmed and left wondering starry eyed after the credits roll .  This kind of work should be rewarded, the moviemakers celebrated and honored by their peers . They were not . They were all snubbed  because Hollywood has  a beef with Mel Gibson<br /><br />This is why I quit paying any attention to  the Oscars years ago (well decades to be more exact)  , The Oscars  are  a glitzy corporate circus , politicized and  unworthy of their original mission which was to award extraordinary talent in the industry - bestowing  credit where credit is due . The ceremonies offer a spectacle but as far as the actual  awards go they are relevant only to the insiders just  as the Nobel peace prize or the Queens  knighthoods .<br /><br /> Still flipping  through the channels these last few days hyped up Oscar "mania" is apparently back , could be that The Wrestler will get some recognition at these ceremonies as it is deserving but you wont catch me staying up at night to find out  ...<br /><br />Apocalypto ********** +
Highly recommended. It's just unbelievable that Apocalypto didn't win a single Academy Award. This movie is so refreshing, original and realistic. For the first time we have a chance to see how the natives of the Americas lived before the Spaniards came. Realistic on every aspect, what a photography, the beautiful natural sceneries and all the details: the wall drawings, the clothes, the use of Jade, the Mayan City. And the set was built just for the movie, it's impressive that Gibson chose not to use computer generated FX!. The "behind the scenes" bonus included in the DVD explains in rich details the hard work required to recreate the Mayan World so faithfully. More authenticity to the movie is given by the use of Yucatec Maya language, still spoken by Mayan descendants in Southern Mexico and Guatemala.<br /><br />Though a little bit exaggerated in the amount of human sacrifices, it was good to have a more realistic idea of how the Mesoamerican natives lived, specially when some modern revisionist have been trying to make us believe that all natives were just some peaceful environmentalists, living in harmony with nature, the famous myth of the noble savage. This movie produces the same reality shock as "Saving Private Ryan" gave us regarding the savage killings on both sides at WWII. So, for me the dose of violence was justified to crack this myth.<br /><br />Obviously a fiction story was required against this realistic historical background (such as in "The Titanic"), but to set the record straight, at least a couple of historical inaccuracies need to be clarified, as well as an astronomical glitch, just to remember that this film is not a history class despite its realism.<br /><br />(1) The Mayan civilization was over before the Spaniards came to America, so the end of the film was just a historical inaccuracy necessary to give closure to the film. The classic Mayan period shown in the movie ended almost 600 years before the Spaniards came to America. The reasons for the decline of this civilization are not well known, but the movie gave us some clues (such as deforestation, hunger and illnesses). By the way, this was a nice way to raise environmental awareness without words.<br /><br />(2) The massive human sacrifices depicted in the movie actually resemble a practice more common of the Aztecs (Central M&eacute;xico), rather than Mayan (they did, but not in the "industrial" scale presented in the movie). The sun god Kukulkan did not demand human sacrifice, as presented in the movie.<br /><br />(3) The astronomical glitch has to do with the total eclipse of the sun. Not only an eclipse actually takes much longer to occur (a license acceptable for a time-constrained movie), but also a total eclipse only happens during a new moon (when the moon is invisible to us because the sun is behind, illuminating the dark side of the moon). Therefore, Jaguar Paw's wife could have never been under full moon later on the same day.<br /><br />And finally for those who really enjoy the movie and became interested in our ancient roots, such ruins of a Mayan city do exist. Visit Tikal, the largest existing ruins of a city from the Maya civilization. Plan a nice vacation to Guatemala and flight to Flores, in the Department of El Pet&eacute;n. The Tikal pyramids are located in the middle of a tropical rainforest. Quite a spectacle. If you like Tikal, then Teotihuacan (M&eacute;xico) and Machu Pichu (Per&uacute;) will be your next stops.
Where did Gibson find these actors? Every single one of them even the children were fantastic. Great visuals throughout. Notice the live lizards on string, the mean little baby Jaguar, the jewelery, the tattoos, the birthing, the Jaguar chase, the fight scenes etc. I could go on and on. Wow! I hope Gibson continues making films nobody does it better. The movie was an adventure I am going to watch it again and again. Mel Gibson wherever you are----Kudos on a job well done, Kudos to the actors and thanks!!
Like any film, artistic license was taken in creating Mel Gibson's epic "Apocalypto" .  However, this one is different.  Gibson somehow succeeded in making and distributing a film that does much more than just entertain.  From the opening scene, the moviegoer is transported to an alien world that most have next to no knowledge of.  The Maya civilization is brought to life, complete with believable characters, incredible costumes and magnificent architecture.<br /><br />It is obvious that Gibson and his production crew did their homework.<br /><br />Archaelogical evidence confirms that the Maya did indeed perform grisly sacrifice on a very large scale, as the film so graphically portrays.  It is also well known that the Maya were more advanced in astronomy than any European civilization of the day; their calendar needed no leap year.<br /><br />"Apocalyto" is no dry historical drama.  It is well written, with fully fleshed characters.  The fact that this film holds the viewer's interest is all the more amazing when one considers the fact that there is not a single word of English in the entire film.  Like many good movies with subtitles, the story is so enthralling that after a time one forgets about the writing at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />In the end, "Apocalypto" is really about devotion to family, and survival against the odds.  The exotic backdrop of the Maya civilization only adds to what is already a great story.  Open minded moviegoers will get a bit of Pre-Columbian history along with some terrific entertainment.
Just watched this movie -- we are way behind -- and it completely blew me away!  The only reason this is not a cult movie has to be the foreign language and having to read the captions.  The actors were wonderful.  The cinematography was breathtaking.  The story, while I concede it was probably not entirely historically accurate, had enough truth in it to draw me in.  I would highly recommend this movie.
Okay, first to dispel the silly notion that the Mayan city-states were long gone by the time the Spanish came to town.<br /><br />Yes, it's true that the original major Mayan centers were abandoned in the Classic-period collapse, but the Mayan culture survived past that.  Around 1200 AD, the Mayan culture experienced a revival and competing city-states emerged.  Please keep in mind that the Mayan culture was not just one centralized culture, but that of several different peoples with cultural similarities. They have been likened to the Greeks in that aspect.  These facts have been drawn from both Wikipedia and the Britannica. See below for sources.<br /><br />Now onto the movie which is the real purpose of this review.<br /><br />Visually and aurally, this movie is an impressive feat.  The image was clear, crisp, and vibrant, and the music was gripping and at times haunting.  It set the tone very well.  In fact, I at times had difficulty focusing on the screen due to the incredible detail of the images.  I have never had this problem with other Blu-ray movies, but this movie was so full of color and detail that I had to look away every so often.<br /><br />The story is gripping and leaves one wondering what's going to happen next.  Without going into too many story details, I was often left wondering if Jaguar Paw would make it away safely in one piece - while in the back of my mind a voice, not very confident, would chant that "of course the good guy will make it out alive" - or if he will successfully reunite with his family.<br /><br />That the movie uses the Mayan language and gives us English subtitles is a plus in my book.  Hearing them speak that language, coupled with the imagery and sound, I was transported to another world.  It made the movie appear all that more authentic and convincing; I don't think they could have achieved that level of immersion had they used English speaking actors, and to dub over their voices in English would have seemed banal at best.<br /><br />However, what kept this movie from a perfect five in my book was what I perceived as an impediment of the ambiance.  The movie attempts to be epic in the struggle of the protagonist in his mad-dash for survival, yet the movie felt very "cramped".  From the city-center to the forest, I never felt that the world portrayed in the movie was open or big in any way.  Even the temple appeared to be "small."  I understand that the movie isn't a "forty-days and forty-nights" type adventure, but it almost seemed as if the Mayan temple was in the back yard of Jagaur Paw's village.  I know that the reality they were trying to convey was otherwise, and this may just be my opinion, but it just didn't feel very grand.<br /><br />Aside from that hindrance, I feel that the movie has earned all the accolades it has received, and not all of the criticisms that have been placed upon it.  Yes, the movie is filled with lots of blood and gore.  The latter Mayan culture had become more militaristic after the initial classical-period collapse, and human sacrifice is indeed involved.  There is an abundance of graphic death portrayals and dismemberment.  There is also nudity - shock, gasp, *insert cries of distress* - so sensitive and tender eyes should not observe.<br />Also, politically-correct aficionados need not apply; the movie is very blunt in portraying this culture in all of its beauty, progression, and brutality.  Like all cultures, they had their good qualities and their bad, and I feel the movie did an admirable job in balancing that.  Others may not see it this way, but c'est la vie.<br /><br />All considered, this is an excellent movie that experiences few hiccups.  It isn't a children's film at all, but remains very human at its core.  It feels authentic and, while I would never use any movie to teach history, I know I felt convinced by the world depicted.  Again I stress that this is a movie, thus it cannot be taken for history verbatim.<br /><br />Needless to say, I highly recommend seeing this film; I find it is an enthralling story of courage and sacrifice (no pun) that will remain enjoyable for many years.<br /><br />*Side Note*<br />If you want to research for yourself about the Mayan culture, its collapse and rebirth, or whatever, below are the sources I drew upon.  No, I didn't focus on making sure it was proper MLA format (*rolls eyes*), it's a review not a college thesis. There are many other sources out there and I certainly recommend making oneself more informed.  Knowledge is power and all that.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Goetz, Philip W., ed. "Mexico - History."

Historical accuracy aside, this is a great film! The blu-ray video and audio display the highest quality, and help capture the viewer strait into the action.  This is one unique action, adventure flick!
Rudy Youngblood, the main character in Apocalypto, deserves at least an Oscar nomination, if not winning it, for his superb performance in this film. Not only does he pretty much carry the movie by himself, his facial expressions speak louder than a thousand words. He is quite charismatic and magnetic on screen, lending to beautiful photography and awe-inspiring scenes.<br /><br />The movie is gory but not in a needless way. Every scene has a purpose for being there. The movie discusses the inner quest for freedom and survival. It teaches us about human nature and human existence --not just entertaining us in the process but making us experience this epic journey, about the confrontation of our fears, as if it were our own.<br /><br />Even though I was not a Mel-Gibson fan, especially after seeing The Passion of Christ and after he was exposed for his anti-semitic views, this movie has put him at the top of my A-fan list. He definitely knows how to tell a story but in Apocalypto he truly shows talent, vision and truth in a way you cannot find in many movies nowadays.<br /><br />Apolypto seems to depict the Mayan culture for its ritualistic style, but not much else. In my opinion, Gibson wants to leave this movie open to interpretation and he probably wishes to define the movie as a concept of culture rather than just Mayan culture. Jaguar's Paw could be anyone, any hero, in that civilization or in today's civilization. He is oppressed and abused as an individual and as a representative of his culture, but what he ventures to do as a hero (combating fears, defending and trying to save the weak while maintaining honor), doesn't portray him as a savage, a bully or even a victim -he is simply human.<br /><br />There are several messages that Gibson may have tried to convey: 1) a civilization can be destroyed from within by creating factions, 2)human nature and how good and bad can exist in any civilization and, 3) as human beings we must persevere against all odds.<br /><br />I highly recommend seeing this movie and I would even suggest buying it as part of your Classic Movies collection --if you're a movie buff, like myself.
These are the way movies should be made if the setting is for these eras, with subtitles!  Makes it beleivable and surreal!
OK, I would give this film 2, maybe even 3 stars if the makers hadn't destroyed a beautiful and magnificent black jaguar. The scenery is beautiful and I really like the music. But the mean guys are over the top. The Nazis seem cuddly by comparison. Acting was good, but I just don't like so much blood. And running, running, running ad infinitum. Bought from Amazon.
i heard many great reviews and finally saw it. I don't know if it is because I am x-military and also a combat vet that the movie turned my stomach more then a few times in the beginning alone, but i found it violent, disturbing enough to want to shut it off. Usually if a movie affects me, i will fast fwd thru the nasty parts, but with this one i didn't even want to continue it. I had to leave the room during those parts. I encountered this mostly in the beginning parts of the movie. I was able to watch the rest of it (after he escapes) just fine.<br /><br />Gibson did a good job definitely with portraying the primitive ppl/times of those ppl. I just can't believe this came out of his head.<br /><br />As much as I was turned off in the beginning of the movie, i am still giving it a good rating, because the director did his job and got across what he wanted us to see and experience.<br /><br />I wouldn't see it again, or own it. This is def just a one time watch for me.
Excellent adrenaline ride. Poignant look at Mayan life in the jungle. A sad look at how people treated eat other.
It cannot be altogether a coincidence that only two weeks elapsed between my viewing "10,000 BC" and "Apocalypto". Both films tell essentially the same story, but the former is cheap, shallow stuff from a hack director, while the latter is a highly skilled and emotionally involving entertainment. (It is perhaps significant that Emmerich relies heavily on models and CGI, while Gibson uses mostly practical effects, turning to CGI when it's the only way something can be done.) It is especially notable that, though Gibson's direction is almost free of any sort of sentimentality, we completely identify with the "good" characters, whereas Emmerich is clich&eacute;d, hokey, and largely uninvolving.<br /><br />Other than being a rousing (and unbelievably brutal) adventure story, it's hard to discern Mel Gibson's perspective. Is he attacking modern American materialism? Is he justifying the subjugation of the aboriginal peoples by the Spanish (if only because it ended human sacrifice)? Does he feel that the Mayan civilization /would not/ have been overthrown if it had not been so deeply involved in human sacrifice? * Is he suggesting that it is America's destiny and/or obligation to rule the world? ** Is he advocating a pagan lifestyle that is close to nature and far from the Christian church? The latter might seem strange coming from a conservative Catholic, but "Apocalypto" can indeed be interpreted that way. It is perhaps all these things -- or none of them.<br /><br />Gibson appears to be using "apocalypse" in its original sense -- a prophecy or revelation. Though there are prophecies and revelations throughout the film, the full intent becomes clear only in the last minute, not unlike "Signs". If nothing else, Gibson is searching for a sense that what happens on this plane of existance has purpose and meaning.<br /><br />Though "Apocalypto" is rightly rated R for its graphic brutality, it would not be inappropriate for older teens. It is a kind of insane "travelogue" that places the viewer in a largely unfamiliar environment, to exit with the feeling that one's life has been altered (if only slightly) by an experience that most humans are fortunate never to pass through. It's for this reason that I've rated "Apocalypto" five stars.<br /><br />PS: Contrary to what one poster wrote, the Mayan civilization continued up until the arrival of the Spanish. (There was, however, a general broad decline 700 years earlier.) If one wishes to dump on Mel Gibson, one might consider his lack of knowledge of basic astronomy. I leave it for viewers to spot the horrendous error.<br /><br />* The film's "title quote" is to the effect that a great civilization cannot be conquered from without unless it has destroyed itself from within. This is ascribed (quaintly) to "W. Durant" -- ie, Will Durant, the co-author of "The Story of Civilization", the mini-library that rests in the home of almost everyone who ever belonged to the Book of the Month Club. I've had mine 40 years, and have hardly /begun/ reading it.<br /><br />** One gets this sense from the Mayan priest's speech.
Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his fellow Mayan hunters are out on the hunt and having a good time in their secluded part of the wet jungle. After making a kill, they spread out some of the body parts, and then laugh at the expense of one of the bigger hunters because of the certain part that was given to him. Just having some good manly fun. Out from the jungle though come some strangers from another tribe. They look scared and beaten. With a warning about how their village was burned and ravaged, they pass by, onto hopefully a new beginning. The next morning, Jaguar's village gets attacked. People are slaughtered and huts are burned down. Jaguar hides his wife and child and then tries to help the rest of his people, only to get captured along with a group of others. They are taken back to the village of the capturers as slaves or quite possibly for a sacrificial ceremony. As the blade is nearing closer, and hope for rain is on the horizon, Jaguar must escape to save his wife and child, who are stuck in a 100-foot pit.<br /><br />Apocalypto was definitely a surprise. For one thing, I didn't know much about what I was getting into when first watching this. I thought maybe it was about why the Mayans disappeared actually (Duh...Aliens took them to outer space). But honestly it's just a story based around the Mayan timeframe. Accurate or not, I don't know. But I did like the movie. While some of the beginning is a little slow to some, I found it fun and interesting. It was nice to see them just joking around and having a good time with one another. As my fellow co-worker said, "I wonder if they really talked or had fun like that". For instance, they play a joke on one of their friends who seems to be impotent. They told him to rub some leaves on his `wing-wang', but didn't tell him they were chili leaves (I think they were at least).  This had him running around frantically naked and even his wife was burning up to (but in a spot you might not expect). The whole village was in hysterics. The action scenes were done really well also. Some say the violence was to extreme, but I don't think so at all. The sacrificing scenes were a tad rough, and I wouldn't let a child watch, but it wasn't too bad. Even `Temple of Doom' had a crazy sacrificing scene and no one really complains about that beating heart... do they? There was maybe a little to much of Jaguar Paw dodging spears and arrows though like he was Neo though, because they were coming from behind and he would always move his head or dodge something without even seeing it.<br /><br />With Jaguar Paws tribe, we also see how peaceful they were, to only have that ripped away from them in total bewilderment by the `evil' tribe. It was sad really and I honestly felt bad for them. Their children being hurt right in front of them, wives being raped or killed, husbands being slaughtered, and then tying up the prisoners to poles and making them trek back to the `evil' guys village. And even after that, I still thought about the bad guys. It had me thinking to myself, "Are they all bad? Do they all agree with what's going on?" Because it sure didn't feel like it sometimes. It had me wondering about the preparations before hand for them. Or maybe some of them think, "Better them than me so I'll just do whatever it takes to survive in this tribe" And when we do see the bad guys place of home, it seems just like any other type of city probably at that time, well... cept for the sacrificing and stuff. But hey, that's what they believed in. Even Abraham was going to sacrifice Isaac to his God at one time to appease him. I almost wish we got a little more on the bad guy tribe. Ah well.<br /><br />In the end, I would definitely give this a shot. While it is subtitled, it's not that bad at all (it never bothers me anyways) and you honestly forget you are reading within minutes...unless of course you are eating or something. It's got a lot of good action scenes in it, and it has a great story. Jaguar Paw rocks.<br /><br />P.S. - The scene with the Jaguar, although cool as it was, looked really bad. It reminded me of Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog from Conan. It really did look like a gigantic sock puppet in a few shots. How Mel Gibson approved that I'll never know. If I was Mel I would have got a real Jaguar and let him go to town on some animal carcass or something. Eh...whatever.
I also saw this movie on DVD format, but found the blu-ray version much more vivid in color.
Don't bother reading what misinformed people wrote in their one star reviews of this film.  I would expect that of those who do not do their homework and understand what Mel Gibson was making.  First, this is NOT a story suggesting that the Mayans were defeated by Europeans because they were primitive and corrupt.  Secondly, its NOT a film suggesting that only through the coming of Europeans were they made better.  Gibson clearly stated in interviews that the film's theme is how civilizations can abuse their own resources and way of life (hint, hint, our own environmental concerns today) which can lead to their downfall from within.  And this is one of many theories today among historians concerning the Mayans.  Thirdly, he was NOT making a film to teach us about Mayan culture or giving us a history lesson.  Get off that one, people, please.  This is a film focusing on the heroes journey, much like Greek myths of old.  And in this particular story, one who has been plucked out of his normal life through brutal capture and made to be a human sacrifice.  Instead, he struggles through dangerous odds to make it alive back to his wife and child.  And many reviewers have flinched at the violence and think it is because Mel Gibson is uninspired to shoot it differently.  Are you kidding me people?  Maybe he shoots it like that because that is how he wants it!  Every director no matter how bad they are have a particular style, and if he wants to show violence, let him do it.  Maybe that is his style, and when I think of any Mel Gibson film I always love how they do not hold back or be PC about situations.  I applaud him for it.  So why only the 4 star rating I give this film?  Because to me, 5 star would be Braveheart, and though this is certainly not that film, I still think its entertaining, beautiful in photography, sets, costumes and makeup, with a good well paced story to it.  And if the subtitles are not your cup of tea, you can still turn off the sound and know exactly what the story is about.  I think that is the true mark of a director, when one does not have to use dialogue, because after all, motion pictures are just that.  Pictures that move and tell a story on their own.  Gibson gets my highest respect for that one.
I initially didn't want to see this, but a friend of mine whose opinion I trust told me it's a great film.  He said "yeah, Gibson's crazy, but he's a great filmmaker".  So I rented it, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This is a great film, a really stunning piece of work that's remarkable in many ways.  There are no big name stars, and most of the actor are non-professionals.  It's primarily told through imagery, and the little dialogue there is is in Mayan.  It's very bloody and violent, though not the gore fest that many critics made it out to be.  It's a very good film, filled with truly awe inspiring scenes, especially in the middle of the film when the action reaches the Mayan city.  The Mayan city sequences alone make the film worth watching, as they are astounding and the best of Gibson's career as a director.  The Mayan city was all a set, one of the biggest ever built, and kudos to the production designer for this magnificence.  After the action leaves the city, the film is still mesmerizing with a great chase sequence ending the film.  The action is well choreographed, the film looks sumptuous, especially for HD video,<br />and the performances that Gibson obtains from his cast of mostly non-professional actors is nothing short of amazing.  They're so natural, realistic, and authentic.  There's no self consciousness at all on their part, and this can be attributed to the excellence of the filmmaking.  The costume design, makeup, and set design are all excellent, and Gibson deserves full credit for making one of the most unique films in cinema history.<br /><br />The first third of the film is a bit tired, with silly dialogue and situations that are reminscent of a teenage comedy.  The opening scene is especially over the top with grossness, but after the village is attacked, the film improves astronomically. While I don't like Gibson the person (he's said remaks that are anti-Semetic, sexist, homophobic, and is prone to religious extremism), he's made a great epic here that can stand along Braveheart.  If you don't like Gibson as a person, you should try and put it aside and see this excellent film.
I enjoyed this unuaual movie.  Though it was not historically  accurate, it still gave me insight into the Mayan period.<br />it was well acted and had enough drama to be interesting.
I wasn't prepared to like this film since I was not a big fan of Mel's "Passion of the Christ" due to the gruesome violence of the film more than the controversy surrounding it. And of course we've all heard of his meltdown in Malibu but don't let that deter you from enjoying this excellent film.  The visuals and the sound are particularly impressive in Blu-ray and it fully captures what I experienced in the theatre when I first saw it. If you want an example of Hi-Def at its best do put this on or "Blade Runner" to test your set-up.  Am looking forward to Mel's next directorial effort!!
I wish I'd gone to see this movie in a theatre. The cinematography is stunning, sumptuous!!(The giant falling and forever bouncing dead tree was one incredible scene.) I guess what put me off was the idea of SUB TITLES!!<br /><br />Please Mr. Gibson, the audience is smart enough to know that even though the characters are very foreign and from an ancient time, we would know they were authentic even though they spoke English. I HATE TO READ A MOVIE!! Books are to be read, movies are to be WATCHED! With all the action and scenery, you have to read fast then try to take in the fantastic cinematography. Plus Gibson chose actors who actually had interesting FACES! The only weak spot was the animatronic animals. They were really chinzy and non-realistic. I believe a person in an animal suit would have worked better.<br /><br />The story was mesmerizing and once it took off you're not moving from your chair until this roller-coaster ride is over! It's a great old cliff-hanger story, the hero getting into one harrowing problem, getting out, then falling into an even worse one. You are literally biting your nails. It's kind of like the old 40's Henry Fonda movie where he must run for several days and nights to escape a gang of Mohicans or Mohawk Indians who are hell-bent on capturing him. Only the reality of saving a spouse in peril keeps them going.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw proved that brains and cleverness would win out over the sheer thugery of his pursuers. I guessed the ending when the protaganist and antagonists stared at the ocean. But a very unexpected ending. Unexpected as all in this movie. A very original and entertaining script.<br /><br />Not for little kids I would think, but hey, they probably see worse every day on CNN!
I am a Spanish teacher, and this is the BEST visual re-creation of the Maya Empire.  However......it is not necessarily historically accurate as to when the Spaniards met the Mayans.<br /><br />The sets, makeup, and costumes, however, are great!
Movie is nearly nonstop action.  Other than that, I have no idea what the point of the movie was.<br /><br />Lots of chasing, fighting, killing, standard neanderthal barbaric brutalities.  Ends abruptly.
I had heard about this film, and happened to catch a couple minutes of it at a friend's house.  I decided it might be worth buying.  I enjoyed the film, but it's not for the feint of heart, for sure.<br /><br />Could have done without the strong sexual innuendos, but the film was gripping.
Gibson is the most original film maker in the business. If Hollywood didn't have an ax to grind against him this would have swept the Oscars. He is the Da Vinci of film - today's great art medium.<br />You are there.
I had my doubts about seeing this movie because I had heard it was so bloody and violent, but after watching it, I am glad I did. Many other reviewers have described the movie, so I won't bore you with that, I'll just offer some general impressions.<br /><br />The opening scenes are designed, I think, to engage the sympathy of the viewer for the forest tribe.  While it might be difficult for many people to feel sympathy for pre-Colombian natives who are violent and even savage, I think Gibson did a good job on this part.  We accompany the men on a hunt, see that they engage in typical "male bonding" behavior, see that they have mother-in-law problems, love and cherish their children, and so on.<br /><br />More than that, during the hunting scene, we see something else: a warning given that was ignored, shoved under the rug. Had that warning of fear been heeded, preparations made to resist the impending terror, there might have been less destruction.  That's a good object lesson for us even today.<br /><br />The scenes of the Mayan city were especially helpful to me.  I have been to Mexico and have studied Mayan ruins first hand.  They left me feeling very disturbed; I could NOT imagine what kind of culture would create such savage and even ugly art.  I don't mean ugly in the sense that it was badly done, not that at all.  But the "soul" revealed in Mayan art is truly horrifying.<br /><br />Mel Gibson gave this art a background for me that finally helped me to make sense of it.<br /><br />I noticed something else: all the savagery, body pierciings, horrible and ugly hairdos of the women, and the general behavior of the culture reminded me of U.S. society over the past 10 years or so.  I know that seems a bit over-the-top, but I have never been able to understand why attractive people would go so far out of their way to make themselves ugly with hair that looks like its been cut with a dull lawnmower, body piercings, wearing clothes that look like slave gear or rejects from a concentration camp, and so on.  It's just bizarre.  (And I won't even go into what passes as art these days, much less music!)<br /><br />When you take those things in the context of what has happened to the U.S. since 9-11, and you compare it to the society depicted in this movie, there are unnerving parallels.  I even think that Gibson intended the movie to reflect the U.S. in it's decline.  At the beginning of the movie, he quotes Ariel Durant who wrote:<br /><br />"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."<br /><br />As the movie came to the end, I was glad that Gibson didn't use it as a cheesy add for his religious agenda...<br /><br />It was beautifully photographed, with fantastic sets and I have to say that the violence was not gratuitous: that's just how things were then and to have made the movie otherwise would have been cheating.<br /><br />Well worth watching; I'm glad I did.
I just saw this movie a couple of nights ago and I didn't quite know what to make of it. First of all, part of me was reluctant to see it at all because of Mel Gibson's apparent anti-Semitism. Being an enthusiast of history and having an interest in Mayan culture and having visited Guatemala, however, it finally peeked my curiousity.<br /><br />The imagery is outstanding. Gibson definately succeeds in creating an aura of intense feelings and emotions. He captures the rain-forest environment and he certainly has captured a savagery that was a part of the Maya world of blood sacrifice.<br /><br />Historically, an inaccuracy was the arrival of the Spaniards, as the Mayan Empire had already long since fallen over a century or two before any Europeans visited the area. That aside, I failed to "get the point" of the movie. I didn't quite get an over-arching message.<br /><br />One point of psychological interest: the violence and the blood involved in "Apocolypto" may relate to "Passion of the Christ" in the sense that Gibson may be caught up in the idea of blood sacrifice. The Mayans easily adapted to Catholicism, probably, because they already had traditions that touched upon blood sacrifice which they transfered to the suffering Christ.<br /><br />All in all, I give this movie three stars. I advise you to rent it. It is an interesting concept, but I don't know if I'll ever block off another two hours to watch it another time.
Sometimes its hard to separate a movie from the actions of its creator.Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is such a film. Many of the poor reviews of this film were based upon Gibson's racist comments rather than a reflection on the movie. For all the faults of its director Apocalypto is a fairly good straight foreward adventure story.<br /><br />The year is roughly 1502 and the Pre Columbian Mayan tribe of Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) seems to be doing pretty well in their jungle village away from the great Mayan cities. Jaguar Paw has a pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and a young son. One morning his village is attacked by the Holcane warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo).<br /><br />The Holcane are destroying villages and taking prisoners to be used as slaves and sacrifices in a great Mayan city. The second act of the film details the death march to the city. Gibson's premise is that the great civilization was destroyed due to rot from the inside and this point is adequately made in the ultra violent sacrifice scenes in this section of the film.<br /><br />The third part of the film deals with Jaguar Paw's escape from the Holcane and his return to rescue his wife and young son. The third part of the film is pure action adventure. More like a cross between Rambo and Run Lola Run. This is pure adrenalin driven action and if you view it as such you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />See this film for the action and not for great social commentary and it's a pretty fair if often brutal adventure. I found myself liking the film far more than I thought I would.<br /><br />The disc includes a making of featurette, Becoming Mayan and a enjoyable commentary by Gibson and cowriter/producer Farhad Safinia.<br /><br />Rent it rather than buy unless ultra violence is your thing.
The lone fighter against all odds is a recurring theme in Mel Gibson's work--both as director (Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ, Apocalypto), but in his acting roles (The Patriot, Payback, Signs) as well.<br /><br />With his latest film, Apocalypto, he takes us to a lost world. Entering through a small village and the life of its gentle families, we meet the Mayans. They love their children and wives, battle their mothers-in-law, and enjoy playing practical jokes on gullible friends. When their serene, forest-dwelling environment is shattered, they begin a journey to another world that (and we) have never seen. Thus begins a tale, an epic journey, and masterful work of film making. Again the dialogue is in an ancient language, but there is sparse dialogue. The images tell the story.<br /><br />We follow the life, capture into slavery, and struggle to escape back to his family, of the central character "Jaguar Paw" (a.k.a. "Almost".) The result is a high-speed, fast paced adventure that is as thrilling (and more exciting) than any cars-crooks-cocaine-and-cops movie. Gibson, the storyteller, is at his best two as we build to the big reveal in downtown Mayan-ville.<br /><br />Not since Gladiator have we learned so much, and been immersed so completely in the ancient world. It is breathtaking, exciting, uncomfortable, brutal, and there are deeply moving moments of human tenderness and bravery.<br /><br />Though it earns its "R" rating for psychological intensity, violence, brief (partial) nudity, Apocalypto is not with out several moments of human comedy and humorous incidents.<br /><br />WARNING: apparently the film is being exhibited in widescreen and not-very-wide screen formats. Check your local listings to be sure and see the panoramic aspect version.
For a story which spans only about 24 hours, I can understand any apprehension about the plot, which seems weak when you think about it. But while the movie played I never felt it lacking.<br /><br />It is not a movie that you will find overwhelmingly intellectual. Apocalypto is a brutal movie. Most of it is very intense and suspenseful, but it is a movie you should see only if you are ok with some very graphic scenes.<br /><br />I thought the acting, what little there was, was good. The story was believable (enough), but the writers took some creative shortcuts which were clearly for convenience. I do not think this movie was made for its story, which was simply woven around some powerful scenes. It was these scenes which made Apocalypto a gory thrill ride.<br /><br />I watched this movie in the middle of the day with a friend. There was no pressure to sit quietly and try to digest its formal elements. We were free to bounce around in our seats and ooooh and ahhhh during some of the more gruesome scenes. It made for a fun movie-watching experience and probably facilitated my enjoyment of Apocalypto.
If you think you can talk your enemies into not killing you maybe you should watch this film. Fantastic story. Emotionally draining and non stop action. It's so engrossing you'll wonder why it ended so quickly. There is a lot of brutallity so if you are squimish about such things you might not like it. Would like to see more movies done as well besides the mindless drivel that Hollywood subjects us to. Excellent film.<br />Steve
A good movie to see more then once, very nice lights and scenery off the world of mayan indians.
I rented this movie not knowing what to expect and I must say that I was impressed! Everything about this film please me from the sets, the acting and the storyline...it's a great film, not for the faint of heart though. Apocalypto is not a film full of weak jokes and frail acting, Gibson went through great lengths to make evert scene seem as real as possible, which is why I recommend it for mature audiences only. I will purchase this DVD and add it to my classic collection.
No matter what you may think of Mel Gibson, you have to admit that the man knows how to get your attention, and Apocalypto is sheer proof of that.  Mainly revolving around Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the film centers around the declining Mayan culture, desperate to survive by offering frequent human sacrifices after raiding and pillaging near by villages.  Desperate to be re-united with his pregant wife and young son, Jaguar Paw escapes, and seeks bloody revenge on his pursuers.  What helps make Apocalypto so surprisingly good is the sense of dread that Gibson manages to create, as well as the surprising amount of action set pieces as well.  Seriously, Apocalypto features enough bloody action that you may think you've stumbled across John Rambo in some scenes, but this helps make the film's 138 minute running time breeze by.  Not to mention how startlingly poignant the film becomes as well before degrading into a cat and mouse chase through the jungle.  Regardless of what you may think of Mel Gibson, you've got to admit that he knows how to hold your interest, and that is one of the many things that Apocalypto manages to do, whether you want that or not.  All in all, Apocalypto definitely isn't for the faint of heart, but it's definitely one of the better films to come from a big name like Gibson in a while.
Mel Gibson's Powerful and energetically charged historical drama Apocalypto is amazing in it's depth of it's main charachters jaugure Paw(Rudy Youngblood)transformation into the decline of his civilization into a more brutally savage and advanced culture is what makes Mel Gibson a master at doing these type of films.He is almost Kirasowa like in putting his charachters in the midst of violence and upheaval, he borders that of Kirasowa to in the amount of violence put in his film, and yes this film should not be shown to anyone younger then 15 it is terribly graphic.<br /><br />But even take the voilence out of the situation of this film and you still have a very fine film about a family man who is dedicated to his wife and child and the members of his myan tribe.Who suddenly sees his entire way of life eradicated and enslaved the members of his tribe killed and his wife and child enslved as animals.To be taken to a much more advanced and brutal civilization where building huge massive temples<br /><br />to sacrifice enslved people to their gods.This is what Jaguire Paw must survive this brutality is how is to learn to become a man, to find his wife and child who managed to escape this terrible destiny.And he does learn to survive and much more as he gives as much as he takes learning to fight like the warrior his father has always taught him to be , but will that be enough to get him back to his familys arms.<br /><br />Many reveiwers have said that this film has many historical inaccuracys but like Ridley Scott did in Gladiator Mel likes to put his charachers in historical backdrops not because of the history but to make these charchters situations more able to paint a picture of there survival.It is always intresting to see how a charachter can survive insermountable odds and jaguire Paw definately learns to survive many of them using tactics he never thought he had, this is why Mel Gibson is such a good director and why his films arent your average run of the mill films.<br /><br />This Dvd has a few features on it in comes in dazzeling DTS for those who do no have high definition it still is the best sound.A commentary while Mel isnt the best at giving them but it's interesting to know his take on this film and it also has a documentary of how this film was made.All in all this is very good film and aside from it's graphic violence it deserves to be praised as a good job done for Mel Gibson.
Thanks to the person who provided us with the facts that Apocalypto is not historically acurate.  Even so this is a 5 star movie, hands down.  I'll take it as it is and hope it looks super on my HDTV.
....that this is one of the best movies that has come out in a very long time.  i really enjoyed it and anyone who sees it is bound to react strongly to it. it's sort of a roller coaster ride of a movie, so be ready!  2 thumbs up!
I just watched this and all i can say is WOW... great flick... very violent, yes... but great flick... outstanding Mel... you ve got my respect
This was a technically accomplished film.  Mel Gibson used a great cinematographer and he knows how to pace a story.  The film and the effects felt real.  The gore looked real enough that I almost lost my dinner. If you are planning to watch this on a date night after having a meal beware unless you are a coroner, policeman or in some other profession where you see a lot of blood this may turn your stomach.<br /><br />The main character Jaguar Paw is likeable the Mayans are shown as one dimensional brutal savages who capture victims to use in mass ritual sacrifice.<br /><br />Plot Summary<br />Jaguar Paw (possibly taken from the monument of a ruler in ancient Tikal Great Jaguar Claw) is a hunter and after an encounter with the Maya while hunting a tapir he has a nightmare.  The next day the Maya burn his village and try to capture the inhabitants.  Jaguar Paw rescues his pregnant wife and son and hides them in a cave.  He is eventually captured by the Maya led by Zero Wolf who takes him to a Maya city where he witness horrible atrocities including mass human sacrifice.<br /><br />The victims are held down their hearts cut out while still alive then decapitated the audience is shown this ritual in great gory detail, not for the squeamish.  Eventually, Jaguar Paw escapes then leads the Maya on a merry chase; he manages to get out of Maya territory and back to his homeland.  During his escape and evasion of the Maya Jaguar Paw encounters Spanish explorers and missionaries.<br /><br />Historic Accuracy; for the sake of time I am only focusing on the big glaring errors.<br /><br />General Errors -<br />Maya and their neighbors were farmers not hunters; so it was unlikely Jaguar Paw and his people were hunters.<br /><br />Maya civilization was well known and they traded with others.  If Jaguar Paw had been portrayed accurately he would have been a farmer who had been to a city to trade or worship.<br /><br />There was warfare and terror toward the end of Mayan civilization for about 100 years; however it was between rival nobles and their city states.  During this period of war the terror started when rivals began murdering women and children of the enemy not just warriors and nobles.  The film depicts the main conflict as cities vs. non Maya hunter gather villagers, just not accurate.  This period in Maya history has only come to light since Maya hieroglyphics have been decoded so it is not something that Europeans would have known.<br /><br />The Europeans arrived 300 - 400 years after the end of Maya civilization- so our hero could not have encountered the Spanish; by the time the Spanish arrived the Maya civilization was gone and the cities overgrown by the jungle.<br /><br />Depiction of Maya Rituals -<br />In the movie the peaceful hunter gatherer villagers were surprised and captured for the purpose of sacrifice.  According to archeologists and historians the Maya only sacrificed warriors and nobles captured as a result of war.  Since war for the Maya probably had both religious and practical aspects it did not make sense for them to attack defenseless villagers with little resources.<br /><br />The ritual of sacrifice that they showed where the captives had their hearts cut out and were decapitated on a large scale is actually a depiction of an Aztec ritual not a Maya ritual.  So if the Maya did not practice mass sacrifice like the Aztecs then why would they need to capture villagers?<br /><br />The Maya commonly practiced bloodletting, men would commonly perforate the foreskin of the [...] and women would slit their tongues and pull ropes through them; this was done because blood was used in many rituals and religious observances to nourish the gods and the spiritual world.  This was curiously absent from the film I guess accuracy was not as important as showing something exciting and scary so they decided to use the Aztec Ritual.<br /><br />Some concluding thoughts -<br />This is about as historically accurate as someone 500 years in the future making a film about baseball and the 2006 wold series.  The director decidies to show the players wearing Football gear and tackling each other because it is more dramatic even though that was not done in baseball or the world series.  Then the director to sell the movie goes out and tells the potential audience that he had a baseball expert consult on the film therefore his film is a true representation of the game.  It might be a good story, but history?<br /><br />If you want a graphically violent, visually sunning and exciting chase film set in an exotic setting then Apocalapto is a good choice; just be aware that the violence is very graphic if you choose to see this on a date I would suggest skipping dinner.<br /><br />Although Mel Gibson claims that this is an accurate depiction of the Maya and says he consulted an archeologist the film truly reflects a poor knowledge of the Maya.  Apocalypto is a good piece of fiction but no hollywood story is as rich as books on Mayan culture written by Linda Schele and David Friedel, or a visit to a museum or a national geographic documentary like Lost Kingdoms of the Maya (1993).  Apocalypto is to Mayan archeology and anthropology what the DaVinci Code is to Religious Studies and Art History; a movie that generates controversey but should not be confused for fact.
"The Road Warrior" is arguably Mel Gibson's best movie and the last 35 minutes of Apocalypto are in line with the greatest chase scene of all time which takes place at the end of "The Road Warrior". Before you call me insane, let me explain.<br /><br />At the end of "Road Warrior", Mel Gibson is being pursued by Lord Humungus and his hated first lieutenant, Wez. Without giving too much away, the final act of Apocalypto centers around Jaguar Paw being pursued by the captor chief and HIS hated first lieutenant, encompassing one long, intense chase scene, ala "Road Warrior".<br /><br />Fans of "Braveheart" may not see this as their cup of tea, but if you're a fan of Road Warrior and particularly the awesome chase scene at the end of it, you owe it to yourself to watch Apocalypto just for the last 35 minutes which are truly thrilling and draw striking resemblances to the classic post-apocalyptic "Road Warrior".
This is the first film in the last year that made me really fix on the screen. It has a great story, a terrific adventure and one of the most complete and hair-raising era reconstructions I have ever seen on TV. Mr Gibson is a great master of suspence and also a virtuoso of story-telling. Some scenes from this film (like that of the captives led across a river, leaving their kids behind) reminded me of the "Passion" and were really heart wrenching. There is of course some very violent scenes in the film but that was really the essence of the Maya era and their culture. In all cases possible, Mr Gibson avoided the pornography of violence and showed only what was needed to transpire the emotions and the agony of the ordinary people fighting against an inhuman meat grinder. The blood soaked nightmare of the poor captives is depicted in a terrific way, as is also the agonizing struggle for survival and family reunion. I wish Mr Gibson will give us many more fine films like this one.
In the making-of bonus feature, we see Master Gibson rocketing around the set whipping up the extras, almost a blur of energy. His magic seems to be to inspire and urge on the best from every performer, costumer, production person. The result is extraordinary. More original than I've seen in decades, more human intensity that I could imagine from an all-out action chase movie.<br /><br />Gibson is brave to use only subtitled dialogue, and it works. Shouldn't be surprising, Mayans never were into oratory. But Apocalypto's simple lines had all the passion of jungle tribesmen in that violent time.<br /><br />Gibson is brave to jump back stories and complex motives. The direction<br /><br />is flawless and direct and never gets in the way of the story. I was gripped immediately and the intensity and drama never let go.<br /><br />But the hearts never beat as I thought they would when ripped from the sacrifices' chests. Sorry to be flip, but there's so much good in this film  I'm sort of speechless, grasping for ways to rave praises without getting too corny.<br /><br />Other movies from awhile ago touched on this kind of concept/action, two are Rapa Nui and The Naked Prey; both were original and courageous too. But this film is the best of its sort that I've ever seen. I hope everyone can see it and it wins all the awards it really deserves. I'm sure I'll see it see it again and again over coming years. It's an elegant movie.<br /><br />Elegant? One definition is that elegance equals uniqueness and<br /><br />simplicity. Sure works for this fine motion picture. Now go buy it.
Unfortunalty, that's what went throught a lot of peoples minds about this film. It is honestly the most intense and original action film I have seen in a long time. It is lean, mean and to the point. Mel does a great job of not only setting the pace for the action, but in the first 20 minutes of the film sets up a group of characters that you really care about in a very short time. Too bad people shy away from sub-titles. I mean, how many people would have seen the movie if it was in English and starred a big name?
Apocolypto is definately a violent movie. Yet, somehow, the movie would not show the brutality and the horror of the Aztec civilization if it watered down this part. Instead, this movie is very real, and in Mel Gibson's way, has a powerful message to tell. And in the final scenes of the movie, I could see how the 'want more' of the Aztec pursuing the young man could lead to corruption, and the ultimate death. This movie is shocking, but behind all the violence and gore, there is a message that anyone can see, and despite the "R" rating of this movie, this movie is definately worth watching. I thought it was extremely well done.
There is no question that Gibson's film is a stunning success interms of re-visioning the Maya universe at the time of the Spanish conquest. Everything, from the hunting gear of the forest hunters to the amazing city, its decor, inhabitants, rituals was meticulously researched and impeccably enacted. One exception was the depiction of the Maya ritual chief ( cruel and opportunistic) and the ritual priest (insanely incoherent). In reality, the sacrifice 'theology' rested on an excruciatingly elaborate and sophisticated paradigm devoted to 'saving Time' and 'Universe' ; showing the 'rational' behind the impulse to sacrifice innocent humans would probably be taking a step too far for the functionally illiterate audiences of today.<br /><br />I particularly welcome Gibson's decision to conduct the entire film in Maya, which adds a new, and powerful, dimension. It is unlikely that real-world protagonists would have understood each other as Maya have a number of different not always mutually intelligible dialects (Tzotzil, Tzutujil, etc) and subdialects. BTW, the name of  the protagonist 'Jaguar Paw'  was borrowed from a real warlord who ruled the city of Tikal in the 4th century (and whose dynasty came, if i am not mistaken, from Teotihuacan or Tula).<br /><br />The purpose of the film, or the idea(s) behind it are not very clear to me. Gibson's film relentlessly pounds the spectator with physical violence, activating the nihilistic, opportunistic and fear-based circuits in our brain. What's the point here - after all, we can see this stuff daily on all news channels.  Does Gibson want to show us that there is a bodily (gory) side to human violence forgotten by Western couch potatos? Or is he himself compelled to keep repeating the same motif over and over again in each film he makes, like a mouse running a wheel in its cage. Perhaps Mel is telling us that he can smell the decline of our civilization, like the Maya (and especially the Aztecs) have half a millenium ago? The story of Jaguar Paw is a non-story: a guy is captured and runs away, wreaking vengeance on his tormentors... There is nothing particularly apocalyptic about it: the same violence is going on today with the janjaweed killing and enslaving the Dinka in Darfur; a few years ago Serbs were murdering Bosnians in the heart of the supposedly 'civilized' Europe and British and US airmen were slaughtering hundreds of thousands of hapless Iraqis in the First Gulf War.  What goes on in the mind of a suicide bomber who blows himself up in a cafe full of teenagers?  I suppose Gibson wants to ask whether we indeed are that different from the post-classical Maya? The suicide bomber is 'defending' his religion, just as the Israeli pilot who bombs Lebanese civilians 'defends' his country, and Aztec and Maya sacrifices were 'defending' their Time. As the 'Fifth Sun' era revolves to its close, are we doomed to repeating the same old patterns, just as Gibson is compelled to make the same film again and again.<br /><br />If there was a positive note in the film, it was in touching a longing that lodges in the hearts of all humans: a longing for living  in nature, within a close-knit tribe led by wise elders, experienced hunter leaders, raucous comrads and beautiful women, and the humor that comes from living together in agroup without being separated by walls, real or conceptual. Few other filmmakers have had the courage, insight or vision to come remotely close to this longing.<br /><br />In other words, this film is worth seeing.
IT'S VERY REFRESHING TO SEE AN ACCURATE PORTRAYEL OF PRE-EUROPEAN AMERICA. NO POLITICAL CORRECTNESS HERE. IT WAS A BRUTAL WAY OF LIFE BACK THEN. INTERESTING THOUGH, NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED. OUR CURRENT CULTURE JUST HAS DIFFERENT AND FREQUENTLY YOUNGER VICTIMS OF HEINOUS ACTS. MAN WILL ALWAYS RATIONALIZE WHAT HE IS DOING. THIS MOVIE IS BLOODY, I MEAN BLOODY AND VIOLENT. TWICE A MAN'S CHEST IS SHOWN BEING CUT OPEN.  THEN, THEY ACTUALLY SHOW THE BEATING HEART REMOVED FROM THE CHEST CAVITY. THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. PERSONALLY, I DON'T MIND WATCHING THIS GRAPHIC VIOLENCE IF IT HAS A PURPOSE. I THINK IT DOES SERVE A GREAT PURPOSE IN THIS PARTICULAR MOVIE. YOU COULD NEVER FULLY REALIZE THE HORROR OF THIS CULTURE WITHOUT THE GRAPHIC DEPICTION AS SEEN IN THIS MOVIE. IT MAY BE GIBSON'S BEST PRODUCTION.
In "Apocolypto" Mel Gibson continues making films that not only entertain the viewers but inspire them as well.  This film is set in the last days of the Mayan civilization, which was centuries before the coming of the Spaniards however this is not a documentary.  Rudy Youngblood as Jaguar Claw leads a great cast in this exciting epic/thriller which is entertaining and fascinating from beginning to end.  The action scenes are great and well timed as the spectacular Mayan city scenes are eye-popping and frightening.  Mel Gibson also gives this movie morals which are important.  For example in the first half of the film the mystery of suffering is present in the people the Mayas' attack.  Why where they enslaving and sacrificing human beings?  They offered human sacrifices to placate their god and enslaved people to pamper themselves, the people were just raw material.  Do we not harvest embryonic tissues to save our own skins? A civilization is judged by how it treats the weak, I wonder how we measure up.  The great thing about all of Mel Gibson's films is that they always leave you wondering.
Well, I disagree with many of the critics of this spectacular film. It reminded me somewhat of Werner Herzog's work in South American. There's an epic jungle out there and the fiercest beast of all is, ah, us!<br /><br />I don't know if Gibson is clinically nuts.  His latest brush's with anti-Semitism and drunkenness were bizarre, but he does show all the characteristics of a wild-eyed-visionary-artist. Apocalypto is a fantastical recreation of a 600 year old Mayan civilization that out-DeMille's any Hollywood historical stuff I've ever seen. Gibson used a ton of his own loot to build a Mayan city so lifelike, it is obviously not computer generated.  The sets reminded me of earlier Gibson projects, a Gibsonionian Mad Max touch.<br /><br />The film begins with a bloody, but good-natured tribal hunt.  Rudy Youngblood soon learns that the city Mayans are out on the prowl looking for slaves. His village is decimated and the villagers are led off to the Gods.  Along the way, he observes the incredible brutality of the Mayan religion.  I won't describe the mayhem, but will warn the viewer that it's much like observing the work of lunatics in a concentration camp on LSD. If you're stomach can't hold on, keep a bucket by the couch because the effort is well worthwhile.
I saw this movie at the recommendation of one of my fellow co-workers whom is a big movie buff.  He came in one day and asked if I had seen Apocalypto, and when I answered no he said, "you have to watch it on the big screen, do NOT wait until it comes out on DVD."  He went on to tell me that despite the fact that the entire movie was subtitled, that it would hold your interest throughout.  Boy was he right.<br /><br />The opening sequence is intense, and within just a few minutes you realize that you are in for alot of gore and alot of action.  Unlike some of the previous revieweres, I don't believe that the gore is meant simply for gore's sake.  I actually feel that the gore and violence in the movie very well portrays the violence that probably occured around that time.<br /><br />Either way, the most interesting part of the movie, in my opinion, is the backdrop of the time.  This was the time when the first conquistadores were arriving in American and threatening the way of life of the Mayas and Aztecs.  I personally would have enjoyed more of this part of the story.  For example, how did these people react to the men invading their land, bringing with them new customs, new religion, and devastating diseases.  Having said that, the movie does a superb job in portraying the despair that the Mayans felt when they reailzed that their way of life and even entire villages were rapidly dissapearing, if at the hands of their own.  Whether you have heard good things or bad things about this movie, I can assure you of one thing, it WILL hold your interest from beginning to very end.  You can take that to the bank.
This film offers yet another look at a civilization that otherwise would have been forgotten by most!  The historical look of the film could only be done by a master of cinema.  While Mel gets a bad rap, you should not overlook this film.
One of the best movies we have ever seen. Have watched it several times. There is alot of spirituality in the movie.
I didn't know what to expect out of this movie.  But I ended up really enjoying it.  I would recommend watching it.  But it is for adults with a lot of violence.<br />This movie was brutal yet very sad.
The movie was done so well - a little too violent, but Mel Gibson did an excellent job.
the movie was fantastic in the theater and just as wonderful at home . a Great DVD , a must have .
A very intense and violent film. Interesting in the adventure gender.<br />But this film can't be considered as an historical document, several<br />mistakes avoid it, in special the final excene.
4.5 stars.  While "Apocalypto" doesn't quite reach the level of overall magnificence of Mel Gibson's "Braveheart", it frequently achieves greatness that equals many of that film's finer qualities.  The visual effects are outstanding, as is the glorious cinematography, and having a cast of unknowns portray a long-lost people from an epic, mysterious culture is a stroke of genius.  The cast is excellent.  If any "name" actor had been in this film it would have taken away from the effectiveness of the tribe as a whole, as a family.  The entire film is in subtitles, as the characters relate to one another in an ancient tongue, which is yet another effective dynamic for transporting the viewer to another time.  After seeing this film and "Letters from Iwo Jima", which is predominately subtitled, I jokingly related to friends that the best foreign films these days are coming out of Hollywood.  That was true until I experienced "Pan's Labyrinth", which is amazing!  As far as "Apocalypto" goes, most of the flaws are incredibly minor, the only parts that had me shaking my head were a few predictable plot elements that are eventually forgivable given the overall grandeur of the film as a whole.  As for the complaints about the excessive gore in "Apocalypto", it is used as part of the story not as a fetish of Mel Gibson, as so many critics claimed.  As far as that goes I found it to be completely hilarious when "Apocalypto" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup, thus backhanding every critic across the face who downgraded the film for its excessive gore.  For a large portion of the movie, at least an hour in total, there is a fantastic chase that will leave everyone breathless.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, both as entertainment and as an artistic endeavor from all concerned.  Bravo!
Just like Tom Cruise's weird celebrity escapades before the releases of War of the Worlds and Mission: Impossible III, Mel Gibson and his film Apocalypto wasn't immune to controversy. A big budget film using ancient language subtitles and not a single recognizable face in the bunch, many wondered if Gibson was off his rocker. While not given the large attention that the Passion of the Christ got, this is at least an enjoyable film that won't really change your life or do anything significant, but you'll have fun anyway...if you can stomach this kind of thing.<br /><br />Set during an unspecified date, we see a group of Mayans living in a remote village in the jungle. One day, a savage group attacks their camp and those that aren't killed are enslaved and traveled a great distance to a Mayan city where some are sold off and others are sacrificed. Among the captured is Jaguar Paw, a young man with a son and pregnant wife at home (she was hid during the initial attack). He manages to escape and he sets off back home while being chased by a group of warriors looking to have his head.<br /><br />The main issue (aside from the obvious religious stuff) with the Passion was the amount of violence it had. Some saw it as a representation of Jesus dying for your sins and if he was going to, he better go through hell to forgive everyone's while others saw the violence as gratuitious and almost quasi-sadistic. Unlike certain films with big violence such as Hostel, the violence here serves the story and is part of it rather than is the story. But still, when you see not one but 2 people getting their hearts ripped out than subsequently decapitated, you kinda go "hm, kinda excessive no?"<br /><br />The film is basically separated in 2: a more slower paced view of Mayan culture, complete with odd face paintings and scars. It's interesting although you can imagine how odd it looks to see sticks through people's noses. The second half though is essentially one big long chase through the jungle with Jungle Paw outrunning his captives and even turning the tables on them. We got many many scenes of him just running which could be a great advertisement for a new diet. ("Wanna lose weight fast? Do a Mel Gibson movie"). But instead of being a Michael Bay scene of just action for the sake of showing off effects and mayhem, this serves as a purpose as he has to get back to his wife who is due any minute and the fact that she is stuck in a hole and can easily drown should it rain doesn't help matters. Some enjoy both halves together while the majority will just look at the chase and go "cool dude!"<br /><br />While it won't go into the collective conscious that Passion of the Christ did, it's at least an enjoyable movie for those who like some emotion with their action.
First, I'm gonna start by declaring that I'm not a big fan of Mel Gibson (as a person).  That being said, after seeing the trailer for this film at the theater, I knew I had to see it.<br /><br />The story focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a young man who has a happy life----a member of a close knit village of family and friends.  Soon, however, his world is destroyed by Mayan invaders who attack the village, capturing the adults (the ones who are not slaughtered) and leaving behind the children to die.  Before he is caught, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and son in a deep cravass but is soon herded off to a great Mayan city for a dreadful fate, uncertain of what will become of his young family.<br /><br />Once inside the huge city, the captives see slaves laboring to build the ever expanding city and crowds cheering, hungry for blood.  The women are sold off and the men, it is soon learned, are destined to be sacrificed to a Mayan god.<br /><br />Fate leads Jaguar Paw away from death and gives him a chance to return to his home and possibly save his family who remain stranded underground.  What follows is a frantic chase, with captors at his heels, as a young man uses his wits (and blessed by good luck at times) to escape the evil that is closing in on him.<br /><br />Gibson managed to make a fast past movie that gives us a glimpse into the mysteries of the Mayan civiliztion.  He also gives us a parting glance at a culture that is dying and at the start of its decline.  The scenes of the peaceful village being attacked and sheperded into slavery are hard to watch and you will find yourself desperately hoping that these poor people will somehow manage to escape their horrific destinies.  While the ending of the movie leaves room for optimism, it also shows us that one evil can easily be replaced by another, more powerful evil.<br /><br />The film is spoken entirely in the Mayan language (with English subtitles) but don't be put off by this.  The story moves along quickly and the action is well paced.  The lead, Rudy Youngblood, does an excellent job as the man who's life is forever changed but is determined to save his wife and child.<br /><br />A worthy addition to any dvd collection!  Highly recommended!
Apocalypto is the story of survival as tribal wars and slavery leads one man on a desperate journey to get back to his family. Mel Gibson directs this powerful film that made many critics claim that it was "the best movie of the year" as well as "brutally violent" and "shockingly disturbing." Watching this film I have to say that it is more about the story of one man struggling to overcome the odds to get back to the ones he loves and even though there is violence its a small part compared to the larger picture.<br /><br />Rudy Youngblood plays a man named Jaguar Paw in Mayan times. He and his tribe are very comfortable, living in their part of their forest. However just one day after meeting another tribe that was passing through their lands because they were attacked by something, Jaguar Paw and his tribe are attacked and taken prisoner by a third tribe. Many of Jaguar Paw's fellow villagers are killed, most are taken prisoner, but Jaguar Paw's wife and kid are trapped in an underground well after trying to escape.<br /><br />After being bound together, Jaguar Paw and a few of his tribesmen are led on a long journey to a huge temple kingdom somewhere far away. It is there that Jaguar Paw realizes that they are meant to be sacrifices to a god that thier captors worship. After what seems to be a miracle saves Jaguar Paw's life, Jaguar Paw has to escape and get back to his wife and child before it is too late.<br /><br />Apocalypto definately is not for those who cant stand the sight of blood, and the sacrifice scenes are indeed hard to watch for their brutally realistic reenactments. However the story of Jaguar Paw stuggling to stay alive to be with his family, especially his wife who is expecting another child, is something to be seen for the powerful performances that are shown in this film.<br /><br />What also is a good original idea for the film is showing the entire film in English subtitles but also with the actually Mayan subtitles being shown as well. I found it really interesting listening to the way the villagers interacted with each other and seeing how different and slightly similar the different tribes were when compared together. Even Jaguar Paw's captors and himself share some common traits. Another thing I liked about this movie is the beautiful scenery. Giant waterfalls, dense jungles, huge fields, and beautiful ancient cities make this movie something that definately needs to be seen to get lost in. This is one movie you should see if you want to see a great film about love, passion, and survival.<br /><br />Extas include:<br /><br />Commentary by Director Mel Gibson and co-writer Farhad Safinia<br /><br />Becoming Mayan: The Making of Apocalypto<br /><br />Deleted Scens with commentary by Mel Gibson<br /><br />I walked into the theater not knowing what to expect. Since it was a Mel Gibson film I assumed it was going to be nothing but violence. However I was surprised by how intriguing this film became. This movie is definatley recommended. Highly recommended.
i am a fan of movies that push the edge even if just slightly. Fortunately, this movie did it's job well, pushing the gore and brutal killing. it's rare when i am shocked by the brutality in a movie because i have become numbed by seeing so much of it.<br /><br />That being said, this was one of those historically accurate/inaccurate questionable movies that really get you wondering whether these people were really like that or not. if so then it's no wonder how they disappeared from the face of the planet, there's only so much decapitation you can do to your own people before there's no one left.<br />as for the protagonist, this was one of the most engaging cat and mouse chases i had witnessed on film, especially when the jaguar popped out. it just had me begging for more. this movie was good enough to make me actually want to go back and research the history of the Mayans, so it gets an extra star just for making me want to learn something.<br /><br />This movie was obviously only for a certain group of individuals who appreciate the director not holding back for his audience. within the first 10 minutes, i had already forgotten that Mel Gibson directed it. Not to say that's a good or bad thing, but it didn't influence my decision on liking this movie at all. It was just a great overall gruesome action movie from beginning to end with almost no down time, kinda like crank. (not saying this movie was anything like that other then the continuous stream of action)
The best filmmakers are the ones who aren't afraid to coat their projects with their own life blood. There are films that you see that you just KNOW it's a window into the soul of the writer or director, and you are grateful they had the guts to do it. Mel Gibson has always taken his fervor, vivacity, creativity and devotion to his work seriously. He has produced and directed such films as: Man without a Face, Forever Young, Braveheart, Passion of the Christ, and Apocalypto. All of those films have personally left me with a sense of wonderment, curiosity, awe and self awareness. Mel, as we know, has issues but unlike some people he admits it and is getting help (sober for 3 months!). I grew up with an alcoholic, so I know the ups and downs and the inner turmoil they feel, we are lucky as an audience to witness Mel's way of hashing out his inner demons. I personally don't know one person on the face of the earth who can judge Mel, we all have had moments or knew someone who did, and we all deserve forgiveness and understanding.<br /><br />Onto the review<br /><br />  Apocalypto is an astonishing, breathtaking tale of one man and his devotion to both his family, and his way of life. Jaguar Paw is everyman. A father, husband, son, and warrior.<br /><br />Who among us could imagine his way of life and the hard work it takes to provide for a village and family, and who among us wouldn't trade all we have to experience that sense of accomplishment and utter bliss. When he sees another warrior, who has been displaced by an unknown ravager, he senses his fear and it worries him. His own father says to him that once fear sets into your brain it takes over, and you can't let that happen. That is the truth; a lot of us live with some kind of fear and it consumes our lives to the point where any happiness we feel is fleeting. Jaguar Paw sleeps in a hut, but has a beautiful family and he is content. When a tribe of warriors comes to desecrate their village and kidnap the men and women, he experiences great loss and feels the fear his father spoke of envelope his whole being. He saves his family, only to leave them in a precarious position and he knows that he has to get back to them somehow.<br /><br />  The evil in this movie turns out to be a city of excess populated by the sick and the depraved and the greedy. A ruler who wants bigger buildings, who demands human sacrifice to satiate the Gods, and in turn their crops will grow again and the diseased will be healed. It's a town where human waste runs through the streets, and the people are idle and do nothing but sit around and use the resources, and where the value of a human life is an afterthought to the sport of the game and wicked morbid amusement. It is a society that is doomed and we all know it as soon as we see it through Jaguar Paws eyes. Gibson clearly is saying here that a great civilization cannot not exist on such wastefulness of youth, resources, and decadence.<br /><br />  Jaguar Paw has a mission to get back to his family and because of circumstances and sheer willpower gets free and starts heading back to them, followed by the same warriors who kidnapped him. They are weary of him because of some prophecy but decide to still go after him because of revenge and pride.  He is wounded but manages to outwit, outlast and draw upon strength of character that none of them have. He is a man while they are merely semblances of men parading around in finery, their brains empty and hearts full of hate and greed. In the end he succeeds in saving his family, and witnesses the coming of a new enemy with the Spaniards landing on their beach. Instead of investigating the newcomers he vanishes into the jungle determined to start over anew, a spark of independence and preservation for his way of life still alight.<br /><br />  My husband and I left the theater and talked for about two hours about what message we got from Apocalypto. Why can't people be happy with what they have? Are we as a society now dependent on too much technology and not enough on the skills it takes to survive without. Is the family unit a thing of the past, Are we all too wasteful and ignoring the lessons of many civilizations that have gone before? Do we let fear rule our lives, the fear of bills and jobs and traffic and gossip. Do we know our priorities in life, and is the number one thing ourselves? Are we too selfish, do we have a tribe we can depend on? Do we listen to our elders?<br /><br />I would tell anyone to see this movie, over the age of 17 of course, it does have violence but not for the sake of shock. I thought CSI shows worse that this movie did! Go see it even if you hate Mel Gibson, because your basically just shooting yourself in the foot boycotting his movies.
incredible moving story and plotline. A man ripped from the ones he cares about has to desperately do what he can to survive, as he is driven by a passion to save the only thing he cares about. If you're looking for non-stop twists and turns. check out this pure adrenaline movie....you'll be wide-eyed and propted up on your seat for the whole show.  If this is what mel gibson is going to do with movies. he may be the next best film maker in hollywood. You can take my word for it and you won't be dissapointed seeing this film! 100%satisfaction
Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is the most amazing, disturbing, incredibly moving movie I have ever seen.  I bought the DVD and I watch it often, each time taking something different away from it.  I highly recommend this movie.  The quick delivery time from Amazon.com was well worth buying it from them!
This movie had promise at the start. Beautiful setting, incredible costumes, exotic characters. But as it opens, it kind of wanders here and there, and never really finds a believable or understandable plot. The opening scenes focus on a certain young man, and you believe he's going to wind up being the main character. About an hour in, the story suddenly and inexplicably shifts to another young man, and HE winds up being the main character. The rest of the film is nothing but "bad guys storm their village, kidnap everyone, how does Main Character Guy escape and reunite with his wife and children?" You already know he's not going to die. You already know he's going to find his family. There's no suspense, no tension, because you already KNOW he's going to outwit the bad guys and win. Jumping off a waterfall? Big deal, you know he won't drown. Chased by a jaguar? You already know he won't get eaten. Rain pouring into the pit where his family is hiding? You already know they won't drown (which brings me to another gripe; in one scene, his wife and children are stuck in this pit, rain water pouring in, their heads are mere inches above water, and in the next scene, they're all up and out of the pit and walking along together, dry and perfectly safe; huh??). The rest of the story has the potential to be interesting, but it's all drowned out with blood, guts, gore, murder, torture, violence, death. Seriously, how many bloody, squishy, gooey ways to die can we see in one movie? Pretty much everyone gets sliced, diced, gored, eaten, stabbed, shot, impaled, beheaded... except Main Character Guy and his family. All the good guys die, all the bad guys die. MCG and his family wander off into the forest to "seek a new beginning", just as the Conquistadors are landing on the beach nearby. Umm.. OK? LASTLY... this is a loooong movie, over 2 hours. Scenes DRAG on... and on... and on... running through the jungle... more running... still running... running some more... yeah, stuff like that, all through the movie. I was hitting fast forward constantly and didn't miss anything. Sigh. Go watch something else, this movie isn't worth it. Gave it three stars for the beautiful settings, amazing costumes, great acting (despite a "yeah, right" story), and really feeling as if you were genuinely dropped into an ancient Mayan culture.
I normally don't like violent films and make it a point to not watch them. But this one grabbed me and would'nt let go. I could'nt peel myself away. If the mayans behavior as a culture was really like that long ago....then thank god their civilization was terminated. This movie is sad, epic, heroic, shocking, terrifying, uplifting, funny.......and heavy as hell. The villians in this movie will etch themselves into your mind. You won't forget them....ever. I promise. Wow. What a motion picture.
Not sure why I've avoided this movie for so long, but I happened to catch it on Netflix and thought it was amazing.  As dramatic and emotionally impactive as Braveheart and Gladiator.  Very real-feeling and raw, and very bloody.  The only part of the movie that wasn't consistent in quality with the rest of the film was the Jaguar attack.  The cat looked like a stuffed animal with marbles for eyes, being moved around on a stick.  It was laughable and took me out of the film for a few minutes, but I was quickly drawn in after it was over.
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ACTION AND ADVENTURE MOVIE. ALTHOUGH THIS IS ARGUABLY THE ONLY GREAT THING ABOUT THE MOVIE. THE MOVIE IS CONTINIOUS SUSTAINED THREAT, WHERE A CHARACTER IS IS NOT IN A GOOD SITUATION. IT ALSO CONTAINS MUCH UNESSARY BLOODY VIOLENCE. THIS MOVIE IS NOT AT ALL FOR THE FAINT HEARTED, (WITH LOADS OF REALLY DISGUSTING GORE.) THIS IS NOT AT ALL A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN.
The movie was very interistering.Haven't really seen anything about these peoples.very grafic and bloody. don't always like sub-titles but kept me on the edge of my seat. Costumes seemed to follow real lines.
what a lovely film.<br />film is art. art is to enthrall, inspire, deviate from routine life, even if it's done responsibly, historically accurate.<br />such a sumptuous, magically colorful production. gorgeous...<br /><br />so, what the heck was all that fuss or controversy about when it came out in 2006, as the u.s. jewish community went nuts over the film and mel gibson, trying to pay off most cinema owners to ban it from being shown? equating Apocalypto as anti-semitic?! what?! it's about the south american indians?! even fiction.<br /><br />i suppose, anything can be manipulated into anti-political correctness bull. so the real question is, what kind of society is it that bans fiction? now that is much scarier than shutting down mel gibson - he's an amazing director, all his movies are well produced, acted. leave the genius alone.<br />obviously he was not drunk for 2-3 years when producing such a great work of art. if you take a drunk so serious, and he's usually not, but there are many who are constantly drunk, then you're a biased anti-racist yourself. grow up. get a life. time is precious. don't waste it on the rest of us.<br /><br />disagreeing does not make one a racist. fact is fact. if you wonder why i write 4 years after the movie came out, well, amazon kept rejecting my comments. now that is pathetic too, since my comments are not racist and there are worse comments on other movies, that promote violence i.e. check feedback on Inglorious Bastards...<br /><br />hope Amazon is more mature by now, not a banner, but supporter of freedom and free speech.<br /><br />thx
The movie is five stars........my only complaint is that no credit was given to Cornel Wilde......whose "Naked Prey" is the basis of every inch of this Mel Gibson rip off......come on Mel, tell the truth!
Received this item in excellent condition, NEW, and at a speedy pace!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHIPPER!
Wow!  This is realistic and historically accurate. If you are squeamish though, it's not for you.<br /><br />Great twists, great turns and not bad drama without the plot being over done.<br /><br />A few nice extras on the blu-ray.<br /><br />Devoid of the usual Hollywood over the top stereotypical race misrepresentations and political correctness, People act as they would have in this period at this place. Most were caught up in the Mayan blood culture but some were practical people making what they could in the environment in which they were born. Clich&eacute; ending though, which is why I subtracted the last star.
i like this movie because is sometime of the history of America before good movie thanks mel gibson's
I've gotten two Apoclypto DVDs from you Cats, I sent one to a friend who had never seen it, he raves about it. I think its one of the best movies ever made, pretty accurate to how it was in that era. Mel Rocks! Yeah and so does Pepsi  and Amazon, got em quick and free. Think its time to twist a top off an ice cold pepsi and get me another point. My favorite drink.
"Apocalypto" is a well-shot movie that moves along at a fast clip.  Gibson wisely decided not to stretch this movie out into a 3+ hour epic, avoiding that temptation and keeping it just slightly flabby at about 2 hours 15 minutes.  There's nothing here story-wise you haven't seen before.  Imagine "The Patriot" in pre-Colombian Latin America, with the jungle dwellers as the colonists and the Mayans as the British, and you've hit about three quarters of the plot points of this movie.  It's not a bad film by any means, but it does keep reminding you of other movies you've seen before - just with a Yucutan flourish.<br /><br />I didn't care for the gross (pun intended) manipulativeness of the first act.  We know the Mayan city dwellers are bad people.  Whether they were human sacrificers in real life, I have no idea - I always thought it was the Aztecs that were the real bloodthirsty ones.  But the depredations suffered unto our heroic tribe were more than enough to make we the viewers cheer for revenge on the bad guys.  Of course, one could make a counter-argument that the first act simply shows the reality of brutal combat without romanticizing it, and I would be hard pressed to disagree.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is worth a rent, at least, if you don't mind some pretty brutal violence.
Excellent movie and excellent purchase.  Super fast shipping from the seller and a movie that you can watch multiple times, even in one day.  The action is excellent and if you enjoy movies from the far past then you will enjoy this movie.  Be sure you can handle some gore and blood because there are some very brutal scenes.
This is a beautifully made movie with a great story. The reasons it is so controversial are A. Mel Gibson B. historical inaccuracies C. violence. If you can get past these you can enjoy an original and timeless movie.
Mel Gibson's public persona evokes nothing more or less than a portrait of buffoonery of late, what with his drink/driving/anti-Semitism/cop berating; not to mention his English bashing `The Patriot' and `Braveheart', (The battle of Stirling Bridge without a bridge! Oops.) But his biblical oeuvre `Passion of the Christ' and now `Apocalypto' implies a directing capability bordering on brilliance.<br /><br />Mayan civilisation on the eve of `Hurricane Conquistador' is a society in decline after a thousand years of being one of the most advanced in the world. A Young tribesman, Jaguar Paw is captured, along with what remains of his village, after a vicious attack by an army of warriors from the big city and taken on a perilous journey for a date with unspeakable evil. What follows is a breathtaking action thriller that transports you into 15th century Mexico and a world of untold savagery.<br /><br />An air of mysticism permeates this tale but it never quite spills over into the realms of the supernatural making a couple of seemingly exasperating divine interventions borderline believable. All the dialogue is authentic Yacatec Mayan and the cast are predominantly indigenous to the Mesoamerica's giving the sensation of an authentic glimpse into the past.<br /><br />Apocalypto is the story of a culture in conflict with itself and thus rendered fair game for the destructive machinations of more powerful outsiders implying that progress and sophistication brings an inherent soullessness, corruption and ultimately self-annihilation. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Adrian Stranik
I don't like any movie Mel Gibson has ever acted in, so I hope he continues to direct because I can't stand him, I think he is a crap actor.  Aside from that I love this film, It takes you on this incredible journey, you just dissapear in the frightening world of aztec warriors and their disturbing life of survival, supremacy and machismo. I was surprised on how horrorfic this film was but it served a historic purpose.
This - coming from a woman who doesn't know what "Blu-ray" means and hates subtitles.<br /><br />My husband and I watched it "on demand" last night and were absolutely riveted to the screen.  We'll definitely buy the DVD.  Say what you want about Mel Gibson - and I really think we should leave him alone - he DOES make GREAT films!!!
This was the first time I have seen this movie. It has a good story line, and the battles were realistic. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
The plot is very simple; our hero must escape the bad guys to save his family. So mostly it's a chase movie. In the midst of the chase we're treated to some incredible cinematography and genuine thrills. We're also treated to the most unconvincing panther puppet ever created. Jim Henson could have made a better panther. I half expected to see Kermit sitting on a nearby branch singing, "Its not easy being green." It took me about 10 minutes to recover from this break in illusion.<br /><br />But despite the phony panther, Apocalypto is a fine film, and you'll leave the home theater feeling as if you've experienced something monumental and vaguely important.
Excellent movie; check out the making of feature on the DVD it's fascinating.  This is such as well made, original movie and I hope Gibson can come up with more stuff like this that's too good for the Hollywood mold.  Too bad this isn't on HD, only Blu Ray :(
I was surprised that I ended up enjoying this movie more than I had expected I would.  Yes, there are some gruesome scenes of violence, but nothing as awful as it could have been.  The worst is seeing a jaguar chew on a mans face while killing him, or the heads bouncing down and the headless corpses rolling down the steps of the temple (as was done by the Maya).  The cutting out of the hearts is actually worse in "Temple of Doom".<br /><br />Still, the level of savagery is quite high.  The life of the Maya was harsh and filled with war and violence.  I believe it was far worse than is depicted in this film.  Certainly, the life of women would have been far harsher than the near equality they are given in this story.  Maybe another reason for the "R" rating is that the dress of the Maya is pretty much as you see it on the murals without any attempt to cover things to our comparatively modest standards.<br /><br />The story is about a man who is part of a small village deep in the forest.  For them this was the good life.  Another group of people asks for passage through their land because their village was ravaged.  I do not believe that they would not have exchanged information about what happened, but they don't talk to each other here.  I hate it when a plot point depends on someone not saying something or asking something obviously important.<br /><br />Along come the warriors from the big city in their fierce dress.  They slaughter and take captive the entire village, including our hero, Jaguar Paw.  We have gotten to know most of the central people in this village so this event is quite powerful.  Jaguar Paw works frantically to hide his pregnant wife and son and then goes to help fight for his people.  He is taken captive and marched to the city.  I appreciated the cruelty and indifference to life shown here.  Again, if anything, I think it was more mild than real life probably was for these people.<br /><br />He and his people are not destined for slavery, but for sacrifice.  I will leave you to watch the movie to find out what happens.  However, this movie is set immediately before the Spaniards arrive.  I mean immediately.<br /><br />The dialogue is in Mayan (I guess, I don't speak Mayan so I can't tell you for sure) with subtitles.  There is really not much dialogue so it is quite easy to follow and what little reading there is comes quite naturally after a few minutes.<br /><br />While certainly not for everyone, and not even young teens, it is a decent film.  Not everything is historically accurate, but I certainly found it interesting to see the people in the Mayan murals come to life in their dress, hairstyles, weapons, forest habitat, cruelty, and ignorance.  I particularly noticed how power was tightly held to the few over the many.  The one real flaw I saw in the film was that the people in the forest seemed unaware of the big city.  However, if you read about the Spanish Conquest, it is amazing how fast news spread and how efficient the information systems were.  And given how important information about people who could destroy you is, I think they would have known everything about the city and its people and intentions towards them.
And this time, no one can say that he's pandering to the religious right.  With "The Passion of the Christ," Gibson proved that a film can be great even if the audience has to rely on subtitles to get them through the film.  In "Apocalypto," Gibson proves it once more.  Although this is a stretch, I'd have to say that Gibson's story here is much like that of William Shakespeare's plays in that you do not have to understand the language in order to understand the story.  The story is told through the eyes, actions, and emotions of each character.  In "Apocalypto," we are introduced to Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his close-knit tribal family.  The story begins with tribal members hunting tapir.  We are introduced to Jaguar Paw's brother, Blunted, and his father.  Though few of the characters are named, we learn quickly who they are and have a relationship with each of them.  Warriors from another, more powerful tribe, attack the village, take prisoners, and abandoned the children.  Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and son in an empty well and vows to return for them.  From there, the story moves to the giant Mexican pyramids and the blood-encrusted culture that base their lives around it.  We see slavery, political and religious manipulation and flat-out cruelty.<br /><br />At this point, the story enters its second phase, where a great chase ensues as a prophecy unravels before the Mayan people's eyes.  We are also given a potential clue as to why this complicated and advanced society suddenly vanished.<br /><br />Perhaps it's not as historically accurate as others would want, but when you boil it down to the basics, "Apocalypto" is two separate stories combined into one.  On one hand you have a tale of a family whose love for one another keeps them going.  On the other hand you have a great chase tale that will hold you in your seat for the entire running time of the film.<br /><br />Gibson has done a masterful job with this film.  He's taken core characters with minimal dialogue and created great heroes and villains with them.  The actors and actresses in this film perfectly exude their respective intentions flawlessly.  You immediately pick up on who's the strong-hearted warrior, who's the honorable and loyal father, who's the sinister, cruel underling, and who's the primary villain.<br /><br />Well done flick that deserves repeat viewings.  Highly recommended.
Even tho the type of actions are historical, it is difficult to view such brutality.  Mel Gibson seems to like the "in your face" bloody depictions.  The costuming and set design are fabulous, as are the make up, tattoo and copies of injection type patterning of the skin.  It is good to hear the Mayan dialect.  This culture is a good example of a religious order trying to maintain order thru fear and force.  It was taken over by another of the same.
Work of an artist<br />Good acting good directing very interesting story very engulfing chain of event<br />Very realistic<br />Fascinating from beginning to end
A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.  -  W. Durant.<br /><br />_Apocalypto_ (2006) is an excellent film directed by Mel Gibson that details the decline of Mayan civilization through the life of a young Indian who strives to protect his family.  Gibson's genius is apparent throughout the film as he effectively captures the atmosphere of this lost once great civilization.  The movie has much to say about man's tendency to over-reach his natural status within the world and through a Faustian bargain with demonic forces to eventually destroy both himself and nature.  The movie also is highly pertinent to our own times, in which Western civilization itself faces an imminent decline and through over-extension man has reached into once "primitive" and untapped regions of nature and demolished them.  The underlying force of Gibson's traditional Catholicism is apparent throughout the film, and at different places within the film the Mayan mythology appears to be aping the Catholic ritual.  To the Roman Catholic Christian, the appearance of elements in traditional cultures which bear a marked similarity to its own ritual are of no surprise as God reveals himself to all nations through Christ.  Gibson also shows the arrival of the Spaniards to Mexico in the film and presumably they will attempt to Christianize this fallen civilization that has become hopelessly corrupt by resorting to human sacrifice and chattel slavery and thus is in desperate need of Christ.  The movie treats the traditional Indian cultures with great respect and reverence, particularly that of the tribe of Jaguar Paw (the central character in this movie played by the Native American actor Rudy Youngblood).  However, the movie does not refrain from showing the brutality of the ancient Mayans who preyed off the forest tribes and whose sun god Kulkukan (the Mayan equivalent of Quetzalcoatl) demands human blood.  Gibson maintains that such cultural degradation can only foretell the coming doom of a civilization as is revealed in history through the Spanish conquerors.  The actors in the film all speak the Yucatec Mayan language throughout and the film relies on subtitles.  Gibson has claimed that the effect of hearing a foreign language spoken in a film (as he also did in his _Passion of the Christ_  with Aramaic) is important.<br /><br />The movie begins with Jaguar Paw, his father Flint Sky, and several fellow tribesmen hunting a tapir in the jungle.  It is noted by Flint Sky that his own father hunted this same jungle, that his son continues to hunt it, and that his son's son will hunt it after him, thus establishing the continuity of primordial tradition.  Such is the traditional way of life for the world's "primitive" nature-loving peoples.  It is after capturing the tapir that the tribesmen encounter a second traumatized tribe who tell of a coming doom.  Their own village has been ravished.  Jaguar Paw and his fellows return to their village but first Flint Sky tells him that he must resolve not to fear.  That night, one of the village elders tells a foreboding fable of human beings never fulfilling their wants and desires.  Perhaps this fable is an allegory for the greater environmental degradation (and the destruction of the very rain forest itself) which has occurred in our own times.  Jaguar Paw awakes from a prophetic and horrifying nightmare only to find that his village is being invaded by raiders.  The raiders ransack the village and kill many, raping the women, and leaving the children.  However, just before the village is destroyed and he himself is captured, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son at the bottom of a pit where they are to remain for the rest of the movie.  Perhaps the pregnant wife in the pit (the cave?) is meant to be reminiscent of the very Virgin Mary herself from Gibson's own religious tradition.  (The Virgin is to occur again in the prayers of one of the women as a slave for the lost children.)  Jaguar Paw and his villagers are taken away as slaves by the raiders and must trek through the jungle to arrive at the Mayan city.  There they are to be sacrificed on top of a step pyramid to the god Kulkukan.  The sacrificial ritual is meant to be reminiscent of the Roman mass.  The movie features an eclipse and an eerie prophecy followed by a horrendous occurrence at the ball field.  Following this Jaguar Paw runs through the jungle pursued by his enemies driven by pure hatred.  To see the resolution of the movie, and whether or not Jaguar Paw manages to save his pregnant wife and young son, you must watch it.  It should be noted though that the Christian theme becomes apparent again when Spanish missionaries and conquistadores show up in ships towards the end.  Thus, begins anew the history of the Americas.<br /><br />Mel Gibson has directed an excellent film in _Apocalypto_.  The movie includes humor but also much seriousness and bloodshed.  (Unfortunately this film is not to be recommended to the overly squeamish who may find certain scenes too upsetting, but to those few brave souls who can bear some of the more gruesome scenes the film has a positive message for all.)  The atmosphere is well done and the scenery and environment is accurate.  The movie is also historically interesting and Gibson has certainly done his homework on this ancient culture.  However, it is the central theme and allegorical nature of this film which I believe is most important for us today.  It tells us that we must stop over-extending ourselves and destroying nature and the traditional ways of life of "primitive" peoples.  Ultimately however, our hope must rest with God himself who effectively guides our destiny as a race.
Apocalypto is a great MOVIE... as long as you understand that this is a movie and not a historical documentary "like some reviewers" you will enjoy it. The action in the movie is fantastic, I definitly will buy this movie.
This movie is a masterpiece. Trust me, you havent seen anything like it. 5 stars!!!
very interesting movie. is a good movie that covers mayan civilization towards its decline. I believe by the time the Spanish had arrived the Aztec civilization was at its peak. Overall the movie is awesome.
Apocalyto was definately the best movie i have seen in a while. Im even more impressed with Mel Gibson.<br /><br />I was expecting it to be boring (im 20, so foreign language films dont really interest me)but i dont think there was even a second where the movie wasnt gripping.<br /><br />Yes there was plenty of blood, and i had to turn my head a few times but i dont at all think that was a negative aspect. Everything about the movie was so real to me, and the acting was the best ive seen in a while (Rudy Youngblood was mesmerizing, and totally hot).<br /><br />I hope the Mel produces more movies like this.<br /><br />Apocalypto is definately a movie i'll be adding to my collection. I recommend it to anyone.
My wife commented after seeing Apocalypto that she had o idea where the story would go next.  Mel Gibson has created a story that is utterly fascinating to watch and exciting to watch unfold. The film is beautifully acted with excellent performances by all.  To name a couple of actors Rudy Youngblood is magnificent as Jaguar Paw and Morris Birdyellowhead is equally good as his father, the wise tribal leader Flint Sky.<br /><br />The story begins with the idyllic life of Jaguar Paw's village.  The film nicely builds its story with a depiction of the peaceful life of the village and we learn about the personalities of many of the men, women and children.  The most amusing part deals with Jaguar Paw's best friend and his shrewish mother.  The old woman scolds her son-in-law because she has no grandchildren and he is taken in by Flint Sky by his suggestion to rub what turns out to be chilies on himself before trying the next time with his wife. In the opening scene Jaguar Paw and his father are hunting a tapir with other men from the village.  After the tapir has been killed and the meat is being divided the members of another village need to pass by and we learn that their homes have been ravaged, forcing them to move on.  This is the first suggestion that all is not right in this jungle paradise - there is drought and disease.<br /><br />Once the pattern of life in the village has been established, it is attacked with the men and women taken prisoner except for Jaguar Paw's wife and son, whom he hides in a dry cistern. This sets the story for the rest of the film as Jaguar Paw desperately struggles to return to what is left of his village to rescue his family from the cistern, which is too steep to climb.  The captives are marched through the jungle across a raging river to one of the Mayan cities where the men are being ritually scarified. Not to give away too much of the story, Jaguar Paw manages to escape but is pursued.<br /><br />Neither my wife nor I found the violence depicted in the film particularly disturbing.  Certainly there is nothing in Apocalypto that we have not already seen in Braveheart and The Last of the Mohicans. Perhaps the goriest scene - when the victims have their hearts cut out and are decapitated - is shot around by the camera, focusing on the reactions of the people. What was highly fascinating for me is the re-creation of the Mayan civilization.  When Jaguar Paw and his fellow captives enter the city there is a marked difference between the city culture and the jungle culture that is immediately apparent so that Jaguar Paw is an outsider among his own people.<br /><br />The quote at the start of the fill by Will Durant - that a civilization is destroyed from within before it is destroyed from without - is the point of Apocalypto.  The Mayan civilization, despite its advances in astronomy and engineering, is destroying its population, given up for sacrifice, to appease the gods that are laying waste to the land.  Apocalypto is a beautifully photographed film with a story that is mind opening and unforgettable.
The description of 'graphic violence'attached to the poster of Apocalypto should be changed to 'unfathomable violence!" Every periodical I could get my hands on pointed out the same. It's what we've come to expect from a Gibson film. Then you have the style that only Gibson can bring to a film, oscar potential. Yet, he's unafraid to pull techniques from the "everyman's director book." He'll use slow motion. He'll have impossible chase scenes, (waterfall jump) but all in superb form! Somehow, in between horror freaks and hungry arthouse schoolers, you have this film fit into. What audiance is that? I wonder how well this film will do. I saw this film on the first Saturday it opened, during the afternoon. It was half filled. Pretty good, considering how informed audiences tend to be. I'm sure more than half of them knew about the vomit enducing violence. And about Gibson's tirade(s).<br /><br />  I've read it's an "Arthouse film for Jocks." It certainly brings the action for the jocks, and the after movie gossip fuel. It also has been out there in mainstream news for a bit. It's been delayed for how long? And was it rain? Hmmm, Public corespondent.... Not to mention how even before it was released, nations of outraged people were denouncing it. I'm gonna stay away from taking any sides. As a movie, it deserves a shot. But, maybe it's impossible for me to see it again. I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean it in a "Passion" way. Gibson is a determined man, who choses to apply his fortunes to projects no-one, I mean no-one would touch with a ten foot pole.
As a stunningly visual action film depicting the depths of man's potential inhumanity towards their fellow man, Gibson has a winner.  But why did he choose the ancient Maya for this plot?  There is no known phase of Maya history or geographical area where this plot fits.  Supposedly occurring at the end of the Maya classical period, near the end the film the plot anachronistically brings in European ships!  Why?  At the beginning of the movie, the names of the young village men led me to think this would be a story about the take-over of Uaxactun, near Tikal, but that occurred very early in Maya classical history, not at the end, and my surmise was proven incorrect.  The gory temple-top human heart extractions are an Aztec/Toltec culture element that arrived very late to Maya territory as depicted in some sculptures at Chichen Itza, but the temples in the film are in the much earlier and geographically distant Maya Tikal style, not the Toltec style.  And both Chichen Itza and Tikal are far from the Yucatan coast, so I was astonished to see beaches at the edge of the jungle, a la Costa Rica. I could go on and on.  So, as long as one can overlook the impossible melange of Maya culture elements, geographical inconsistencies, and anachronistic plot elements, intermixed with the depiction of what is actually an Aztec religious zealousness gone fanatic, the basic story and its filming provide a thrilling ride.  But let's not pretend that this is a story about the Maya or their decline.  It's not.
I was very happy with my movie- it was in great condition, and delivery was prompt.  I'm truly enjoying it -
I enjoyed the movie very much.  It gave an insight of what life might have been like back then.
People see the name Mel Gibson and automatically think negative. Place that aside and watch the movie.  Acting is 5 stars (even the 2 year old with his mother. His reaction in scenes is priceless), storyline is 5 stars, plot is 5 stars, cinematography is 7 stars, end of movie is totally unpredicted and perfect - 10 stars. Don't be scared because of the use of  subtitles. This movie uses subtitles sparingly and they don't flash on the screen then disappear before you can read them, like European/Asian movies.  Once the movie gets started you can follow the action without the subtitles if you elect.  This movie should be elevated to the all-time heirarchy with greats like Ben Hur, Gone With The Wind, Star Wars, Avatar, the GodFather or Lawrence of Arabia.  It is simply spectacular.  Job well done. You  know it is a fantastic movie when you can watch it again and again and again and again. Wow.
This film was excellent. Violence, love, hatred, devotion, helplessness, and every emotion known to man is in this film.  If you don't like English sub-titles, you will not like this film.  Beautiful scenery.<br /><br />The length this man goes to to save his pregnant wife and child is an inspiration to man's capacity to love.  Gives hope amongst all the death in this film. Unnecessary death.<br /><br />WARNING:  Ending revealed below:<br /><br />The ending was profound.  A man lives because of the interruption of ships landing on a beach and yet his race in history changes negatively forever.
I took my time to review just the 1 and 2 stars critics. And all I can say is: What a load of crap!<br /><br />- A lot of "critics" said it was a "gory movie"<br /><br />Gimme a break!! "Gory" is crap like Hostel, Saw, Devil's Rejects and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so-called "movies" in which a platoon of men and women is tortured and butchered for no apparent reason other than fun.<br /><br />All I can say is thanks Mel for saving us for all the flaying, eye-gouging, roasting, disembowelment, piercing, emasculation and impallement that the mayas were so fond of, and just giving us a couple of beating hearts and cut heads!<br /><br />Besides, I think in Iraq and Afganistan worst things are happening - very gory - and I don't see the same reaction.<br /><br />- Some of these "critics" said it was "historically inaccurate" because it despicts the Spaniards' arrival when "we all know that the Mayas had vanished centuries before that".<br /><br />Dead wrong!!! We - the people that finished school - all know that mayan cities like Chichen Itza, Uxmal, Mayapan, Chetumal and Tayasal were still populated until almost 1700 (18th century), when they were finally conquered by the Spanish!!!<br /><br />Please, go back to school instead of giving history lessons!!!<br /><br />- Other said "mayas were mathematics and astronomers" and "didn't sacrifice people like that".<br /><br />Do you, people, really know just something about the mayas???<br /><br />All archeologists know that these guys sacrificed people just as wantonly as the Aztecs, and in the same numbers, and that they were obsessed by the skies not because they were mystic or new age, but for very earthly reasons: the old game called dominance (you know: information is power).<br /><br />Just pay atention to the scene of the sacrifice and the eclipse, and the mocking smiles of the king and the high priest at the top of the pyramid, knowing exactly how to dominate the ignorant populace below with a perfectly predictable astronomical event, and easily manipulating the massive fear caused by those minutes of "darkness".<br /><br />The laugh of the bloodied priest tells all!<br /><br />- Someone said "A lunar eclipse does not come and go in a matter of a few minutes"<br /><br />Hello, earth???<br /><br />A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow!!! A solar eclipse is when the moon gets between the earth and the sun, making it "dissapear" and it just lasts seven minutes at most!!!<br /><br />- Finally, people just hate Mel because he's rich, drunk, christian and antisemite, in other words... Just plain human.<br /><br />That's why the reasons for 1 and 2 stars look the same.
"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within." This quote by Will Durant flashes on the screen at the beginning of APOCALYPTO and signals the message of the movie: a morally and economically troubled Mayan civilization is "rotten ripe for the fall", to quote another source, and the Conquistadors are landing on the Yucatan Peninsula to do the job. APOCALYPTO goes about showing us this rot that is a brutal, bloody, inhuman Mayan society while telling a classic action-chase tale. Jaguar Paw, a warrior in a small village, is captured by ruthless Mayan soldiers and taken back to the Mayan capital city to be sacrificed with others from his village on a pyramid. He manages to escape and is chased by Mayan fighters through the jungle.<br /><br />So much for the plot. What about the theme suggested by Will Durant? The film makes a good argument that the Mayans were vulnerable but even a morally sound, economically strong Mayan society could not have defeated the Spanish. Why? Because, while the Spanish were small in number, they had horses, muskets, steel swords, and head and chest armor. Not only that: the Spanish were just as ruthless as the Mayans. There was no way even a healthy Mayan civilization could have fended off the Spanish; it may have taken just a litle longer before the inevitable end.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO is brilliant movie-making and grand entertainment. Three cheers for director Mel Gipson. And forget what you've heard about bloody, sacrifical heart removals. This is a tiny part of the movie and is not nearly as bad as rumored.
I should say, it seems very realistic, because I have no knowledge of Mayan culture other than this movie. But the costumes and sets and cinematography are as good as I have ever seen. The scenery alone made me feel like I was really there. Incredible. The level of research and attention to detail are obvious from beginning to end.<br /><br />The plot, for lack of a better term, of this movie is pretty basic, but the adventure Gibson takes you on is one to remember. Yea, there is alot of running, but you would run from these guys too! The realism is amazing. When they are on top of the temple about to be...WOW!!<br /><br />Too bad Mel got himself in trouble when he did, this movie would have been much bigger, and it deserved to be much bigger. He is fearless as a moviemaker, which often provokes some hypocritical criticism, e.g. his movies are too violent, yet these same people will go ga-ga over a Tarantino movie and will remain silent about the endless stream of horror/torture movies that seem to come out every weekend.<br /><br />Whether you like his movies or not, Gibson goes the extra mile to make a mature, realistic, entertaining, and somewhat educational movie, instead of a typical hollywood production aimed at teenagers. You will be talking about his movies, like them or not, long after you have forgotten the typical Hollywood production. I appreciate what he does and I hope he makes many more movies.
I'm not going to go into a plot synopsis of this film, since the other individuals who have preceeded me have already said plenty.  However, I will say that I thought "Apocalypto" was driven, at least in part, by William Golding's "Lord of the Flies", all the way up to the film's ending.<br /><br />"Apolcalypto" was a film that pretty much delivered what I expected it to deliver. There is brutality and gore in the film, but those were minor aspects of the story, which starts slowly but unfolds at an increasingly rapid pace.<br /><br />It would have been great if the Mayans were more modern in their approach to finding ways of resolving the problems that led to the death of their civilization, but, simply stated, they weren't.  Human civilization has a long history of cultures and movements borne of violence, from the distant past all the way up to the present day.  If brutality was the norm regarding certain aspects of Mayan culture, it would not have been the first in the history of humanity. It's something that I don't think Mel Gibson needs to be apologetic about. After all, the Mayan pryamids were probably not erected by unionized workers.<br /><br />Is this a historically accurate film? I don't know. I wasn't there... were you?  While I don't even come close to holding a doctorate in Mayan Culture, I would have to imagine that "Apolcalypto" was to some degree, approximately accurate.<br /><br />Gibson attempted to illustrate the problems which confronted the peoples of a primitive culture, and he was successful, which is what was important, anyway.  After all, very few films based on history don't fail to take poetic license when it come to dealing with how things actually were, versus our perception of how things were.  The list of examples, which would contain the names of many great films, is too numerous to mention.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is not something for your wife and kids to watch while consuming quantities of butter popcorn and five-buck soft drinks; It is not family fare.  It's also not a "Dinner and a Movie" fare either.  If you take a date to see this film, you'd better be sure that your partner wasn't a regular viewer of "Sex and the City", because I guarantee you, it's an unworkable combination.<br /><br />Any film or play worth watching contains conflict of some sort. "King Lear" and "MacBeth" portrayed the very human traits of brutality and evil. Neither was about a protagonist who has feelings he or she can't resolve, which without any action being taken, are somehow resolved at the end of the story.  For that reason, I hate modern television.  Shows like "24", "Grey's Anatomy" and "Desperate Housewives" are garbage soap operas. I'd rather watch reruns of "Green Acres", but that's another story.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is a great film in terms of cinematography.  There was, generally, a lot to think about during the film's 138 minutes.  Overall, I thought it was a very good film, but not a great film on the order of "A Man for All Seasons", or "Lawrence of Arabia".  Still, I gave it five stars for effort and for technique.<br /><br />If you saw this film and didn't like it, all I can say is that the next time you go see a film or rent a dvd, you might want to pay attention to the film's reviews, read any plot synopsis available and especially pay attention to which demographic group to which the product is being marketed.  That way, if you're expecting "Aliens Versus Godzilla VI" to be a remake of "Crimes of the Heart" you won't waste your time.
Set during the Mayan Empire's decline, Apocalypto charts the story of Jaguar Paw (wonderfully played by Youngblood) who is torn from his idyllic life and pregnant wife and son. His village is plundered and the survivors are captured by a neighboring warring tribe and taken to the Mayan city. The imagery Gibson created of the Mayan civilization is spectacular. The virtual unknown indigenous South American cast with their daub, garb and piercing are fascinating viewing as are his visual creations of the city and temples. As with Gibson's previous film, The Passion of the Christ, this too is told through another practically dead language: Yucatan Maya dialect. Don't let this put you off though as it doesn't detract from the film and there's not much speaking anyway. Narrowly escaping being sacrificed in a ritual offering Jaguar Paw flees to the forest and with a survivors spirit attempts to return to his family. Hunted by the Mayan warriors, he uses his knowledge of the forest to out wit them and stay alive. The "second half" of the film is fast paced and entertaining action. I don't know how authentic Gibson's barbaric portrayal of the Mayan peoples is but Apocalypto effortlessly transports the viewer into that time and place and the running stream of love, determination and survival that runs through its core makes it a moving film.
Apocolipto is the newest film by actor/director Mel Gibson.  I didn't have the pleasure to see this on the big screen, so I missed out.  This movie falls into the historic realm of criticism for continuity and what we know to be true about the Mayan people.  This is ridiculous to me because it's always films like this that they criticize.  First off the film is accurate with most things.  The way the culture was at the height of there existence, the way their religion dictated their laws and how they treated people that lived within that culture, the weapons used are very accurate and even the colors depicted in the film are colors they could have access to by extracted them from various plants and animal organs. The materials used like stone, jade and a super hard and sharp glass element that was prevalent in this region that was used for weapons and other cutting tools.  He also uses the native Mayan tongue throughout the entire film.<br /><br />To me Mel did a wonderful job in keeping this story and look of the film as real as possible.  The biggest problems these sudo-historians complain about are that the Spanish conquistadors would not have been in the Yucatan at this time.  When they arrived, the Mayan culture was already declining. Many historians believe that is how they got wiped off the face of the planet, their culture was not working as a whole anymore and was cannibalizing itself with war and ramped disease.  They were destroying themselves long before the Spanish arrived.  Mel Gibson didn't put a time stamp on this film on purpose. I believe he wanted to show the Mayan at their height and suggest through a few keys scenes in the film that they are headed for a rude awaking.  I think the film is an honest look at these people that we know little about and how their culture is beautiful yet barbaric, much like our own.  No matter how much power you have, if your culture is not strong from within, your culture is destine to meet its demise.<br /><br />Gibson shows me two things in this film.  First and foremost he is a suburb director and knows how to tell a compelling story with just images.  Take out all the subtitles and this film still is entertaining not to mention you would be about to grasp most, if not all, of the major plot points.  This skill in storytelling is foreign to most directors that make their bones doing the typical Hollywood action movie.  Secondly, Gibson is not afraid to direct a film with somewhat obscure setting and subject matter using little knows actors playing larger than life characters with tons of close-up "hero" shots.  This film is compelling and moving, anytime you can connect with people that have been gone for 500 plus years you are doing your job as a director.  The Action never stops in this film and the brutality Mel gets criticized for is an honest reflection of this culture. This film is almost flawless in its execution and should have gotten more praise than it did.  The best type of ending to a movie is when it leaves you guessing, wondering but yet satisfied that you've come to a concussion of this story.  You get closure from the film and the characters you invested time into but also know there is still questions to be answered.  I wish more films were done with such care, precision, passion and admiration for the subject matter.  This film was ambitious and the end product is a masterful piece of hardcore action/adventure entertainment. If you want to see a truly brutal film, wait until they make an accurate depiction of what the Spanish/European conquerors and explores did to the indigenous people of this region and North America as a whole.  Then you'll see brutality.
Wow, what can I say? I put this movie off for so long due to all the reviews talking about how graphically violent it is.  Yes, its violent.  I wouldn't recommend it to someone who gets squeamish but  the violence isn't that much different from Braveheart, Gladiator, or even the Passion.  In fact, the scourging scene from the Passion is worse than this.<br /><br />Apocalypto tells the story about a man named Jaguar Paw who is having a very bad couple of days.  He is captured by a group of marauders/mercenaries, etc who capture people for slaves and sacrificial victims. As his village is being attacked, he manages to hide his very pregnant wife and young son.<br /><br />This movie is set during the post-classic period of Maya civilization, around the time when they were being influenced by other groups (ie. the Aztec,etc).  There is a small part at the end of the movie that will date the movie more precisely.<br /><br />The attention to detail is superb from the costumes, the cinematography, the make up, etc.  You will actually feel that you are back in time.  I know that what we see on the screen is a composite of several time periods of Mayan civilization and I think that Gibson did blur a bit of the Maya culture with that of the Aztec but other than that and a few quibbles about astronomy, the film is brilliant.<br /><br />Definitely watch this movie.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat :).
this film made me feel like i had traveled thru time, what an accomplishment, the scenes at the maya empire are amazing, brutal at times but done tastfully, i am totaly impressed with mel gibson, this should have gotten a best foreign film nomination or something, hollywood is just jelous of mel gibson, cuz he can do what they wish they could do, make a great movie.
Mel does it again.  Here's another bloody epic in a ancient language.  I was glad that Mel has finally realized he's too old to play the hero as he was in Brave Heart, but maybe the absence of ethnic genes had something to do with it.  The actors were all believable and I found their anonymity to be a plus.  I had no expectations of how they should or should not act. I was especially enthralled by the birth scene.  There were no leading roles for women in this film (also a Gibson trait), but the birth scene was wonderful.  Mel captured the determination and commitment of woman to bring forth life no matter what the circumstances.  He likes blood and there was plenty of it in this effort.  He went to great lengths to create new ways to butcher people.  I don't know how accurate the movie was historically, but it is a movie after all and the costuming and makeup are worth watching even if you have an aversion to violence.  Since we really don't know what happened to the Mayans (or the Aztecs) the ending was appropriatly mysterious leaving their demise to the imagination of the audience.
This is a great story, funny at times, but full of drama too. I do wish it was in "full screen". The first time I saw it, I did all of the reading. The next time I knew what it was about & didn't have to do much reading. It's one I'll watch over & over.
We really love the movie.  It's such a story of these people.  It's takes patience 'til you see what it's about.  Don't compare it to any hollywood movies.  This to me is more documentary than theatrical.
This is one of the most exciting Action/Adventure movies up to date! Apocalyto is a very violent and gory movie, so it may not be suitable for children under the age of 13. It is quite obvious that Mel Gibson worked very hard on this motion picture. The movie in some parts can be somewhat unrealistic, but Mel Gibson still did an excellent job recapturing the Mayan culture. This is a must see for any fan of the Action/Adventure genre!
This is certainly one of the best Mel Gibson has directed.  Right up there with braveheart.  There was a lot of controversy before this came out in theatres, but it really isnt that extreme.  There is some blood and guts, typical of any Gibson flick.  That's what keeps us coming back for more.  Unlike most historical films this movie doesn't have any political undertones.  In all a very solid film.
Apocalypto was a great movie. It has a good beginning and it keeps you engrossed from start to finish. The story line is about a Myan warrior who faces adversity from being caught and enslaved by a neighboring group. I would recommend this movie for anyone looking for entertainment, but it is a bit violent-not for the faint of heart.
Apocalypto redefines might.There is nothing subtle about this film. One of the few things that stand out in this film is how good the acting is.The characters seem totally oblivious to the camera.The action has its own applauding pace, the characters have their own shortcomings in execution of the most direst of straits of moves while the weather, sun and the moon have their own influence.This movie took me by surprise.The brutality might seem exaggerated but we're men and WE LIKE THIS.I loved the two major villains of the film.Their eyes convey no respite and sometimes the chase scenes seem to actually make you want not to blink.Yes,there is blood but not to the extent to make it seem obscene/overdone. What I absolutely loved about the film is the taunt of one of the villains (Clue - "Almost") Enough said. You will like this film if you want to get your money's worth. This does figure among the top ten movies I saw in 2006 and believe me, I've seen my fair share. A huge cheer of respect for Mel Gibson. Two words, WHAT NEXT
This movie has been heavily criticized by many (at least, where I live) but this is actually a great adventure film. The second half of the movie, as the hero is chased through the jungle by a group of Mayas, is terrific and breathtaking film-making, the best thing that Gibson has ever made. Of course, if cinematic violence is not your cup of tea, you might be better off skipping this film. Now, in terms of history, there are several inaccuracies that are obvious to even those of us not heavily versed on the Mayas. Though recent archaeological findings has made obvious in recent years that the Mayas practiced (as many societies throughout history) human sacrifices, the way they are portrayed here seem more related to the Aztecs. Another obvious mistake is having the Spaniards appear at the end: the Mayas had already left the cities by the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century (for what reason, is the major mystery of the Mayas), and were living in rural villages.
"Mel Gibson's Apocalypto" opens with a quotation from the philosopher-historian Will Durant: "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."  This is a great quote, but extremely problematic for the movie that follows.  The campaign by the Spanish conquistadors against the Maya states began in the early 16th century and ended at the end of the 17th century when the last Maya stronghold, the Itza capital of Tayasal on Lake Pet&eacute;n Itz&aacute;, fell.  The Maya were organized into a number of independent states that had to be conquered one by one, in contrast to the Spanish campaigns against the Aztec and Inca nations where overthrowing a single political center proved to be the key to conquest.  Durant's quote talks about corruption within being followed by external conquest, what we usually associate with the decadence that preceded the fall of Rome, but that does not apply to what happened to the Maya.  Besides, even those Mesoamerican cultures that did not engage in human sacrifice were going to be immune to the myriad diseases that Europeans brought to the Americas and which decimates entire peoples.<br /><br />By the time this movie came out in 2006 the fact it was entitled "Mel Gibson's Apocalypto" hurt rather than helped it at the box office.  On July 28, 2006, Gibson was arrested in California for speeding and on suspicion of drunk driving.  During his arrest Gibson made a series of anti-Semitic remarks, and since his previous film, "The Passion of the Christ," was criticized for alleged anti-Semitic elements, this was potentially a major nail in the coffin for Gibson.  "Apocalypto" cost $40 million to make and took in just short of $51 million in the U.S., which would make it a major disappointment.  But beyond the bad publicity for the man who co-wrote (with Farhad Safinia), directed and produced the film there was the additional hurdle that all of the dialogue is spoken in the Yucatec Maya language, which is still spoken today.  The fact that there are subtitles involved will remind many viewers of Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ," as will the depictions of violence (to a lesser degree).  Just let me say that I ended up watching this DVD by myself because nobody else wanted to "read" the movie.  This is too bad, because the film is a visual delight.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is set in Mesoamerica on the eve of the arrival of the Spanish, presumably on the Yucatan peninsula.  After a tapir hunt, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and the group of young hunters led by his father Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead) encounter a group of refugees who seek permission to pass through the forest.  More important than the Durant quote is the story told that night by the village elder of how human beings always want more, despite having the best gifts from each of the animals of the forest.  The fable comes to life when a party of Maya raiders, led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), attacks the village.  Jaguar Paw is able to lower his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and his young son by a vine into a small ground cave before he is captured by the vicious Middle Eye (Gerardo Tarcena).  While the captives are taken to a Maya City, Jaguar Paw worries about his wife and child, trapped in the cave and unable to escape..<br /><br />Actually, for most of the last act of this film you will not be doing a lot of reading, because "Apocalypto" turns out to be, in the end at least, a chase movie.  "Death Proof" was suppose to be a big time chase movie, but I have to tell you "Apocalypto" is a whole lot better in that regard.  The movie I was reminded most of us ended up being "The Last of the Mohicans," not just because most of the action takes place in a lush green forest, but also because most of the memorable moments in both films have to do with people look at each other.  It has been a long time since I have seen somebody bore holes through people with their eyes the way Zero Wolf does in this movie.  Actually, there is another point of comparison between the two movies in that Jaguar Paw runs even more than Nathaniel ever did.  I want to add that my favorite performance in the film was by Morris Birdyellowhead: in his final scene as Flint Sky, I was no longer aware that he was acting, so thoroughly had he become his character for me.<br /><br />The title does not have anything to do with the related term apocalypse, despite the obvious implications, because "Apocalypto" is a Greek term that translates as "new beginning."  The significance here is more ironic than anything else, because the story really is about an ending more than any beginning that takes place after the final credits.  "Apocalypto" was nominated for Oscars for Makeup, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing, and certainly the makeup and costumes we see in the Maya city are absolutely spectacular.  However, while the depiction of Maya culture, architecture and dress is visually impressive, it has been criticized by scholars as being unauthentic and superficial.  Apparently the film takes bits and pieces from various people and time periods to create this picture of the Maya.  Fortunately I never take what I see in movies as gospel when it comes to history and culture, and I would encourage you to check out what you can find online about the Maya once this film sparks your interest.  I have already learned a lot on the subject.
To be honest, I thought Apocalypto had all the makings of a new Heaven's Gate. Obsessed director, gimmicky idea regarding a lost culture and scripted in another dead language (see Passion of the Christ).  Boy, was I wrong.  Apocalypto, with its Lost World setting, is, if you just look at the plot, a lean and mean action film.  If you've ever seen the old Cornel Wilde flick, Naked Prey, you essentially have a good chunk of Apocalypto, as the hero, Jaguar Paw, races through the jungle, pursued by Mayans, while at home, his wife and child are in great, and growing, danger.  It's edge of your seat suspense that never lets up.  But on another level, Gibson has something to say about civilizations and how they kill themselves. The Mayan's are about as decadent and pagan (in a bad way) as it gets. There were times, as you were led through the Mayan city, that I thought this could be Mars.  It is unsettling and it is brutal, right down to the colors and clothing of the Mayans.  If a civilization can become demonic, certainly this one, as portrayed by Gibson, was.  The sacrifice scenes could easily come out of the Old Testament, the god being worshipped: Baal. And underscoring that is a little girl's prophet-like condemnation, that upsets the Mayan soldiers.  They themselves sense something is in the air, a bad moon is on the rise.  Spiraling out from this is a landscape that is denuded by poor usage, while plague gnaws at the edges of the Mayan world.  Yes, it is a movie set in the past, but one can't help thinking that Gibson is projecting this vision on the here and now.  It's a short leap from a world where heads are being tossed down temple steps, to one where beheadings can be viewed on the internet.
Why am I saying this, even when seeing so many controversial and negative critics about this movie and Mel Gibson himself lately? Well, to be honest, this is not a movie for everyone. Especially for those who can't bear extremely violent scenes in the cinema. It is rated "R" in US and the equivalence in most countries. The movie is even banned in Mainland China. However, if you take the violence element apart, this is by all means an inspiring and thought-provoking piece of work. After all, the killing & brutality shown in the movies are no pretentious Hollywood movie acts, but only to reflect the primitive nature of the then Mayan civilization, the cruelty of human species and the struggles for survival. Some may argue if Mel Gibson has a predilection for unrelenting violence in all his directing movies (Braveheart, Passion of Chirst, Apocalypto) - even though they are in different contexts. Well, it may just be coincidence - I don't know!<br /><br />I have no knowledge of the historicity of the story, but it sets out in a 15th century pre-European-invaded Maya village in South America. The movie began with a tapir hunting scene of the tribal warriors, followed with scenes of simple, peaceful and harmonious tribal village lives. Then came with the thrilling parts of the movie with the attack of the village by another savage tribe, the killing and the tortures of the captured, the human sacrifices, and the chases. With his home village destroyed, children abducted, and fellow residents slaughtered and captured by the brutal tribes in demands for slaves and human sacrifices, brave warrior Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) had his twisted fate and struggled to escape from the chase of the villains.<br /><br />There are several shocking scenes in the movie, which were crafted with unique scriptwriting and surprisingly good acting. I would say many of these are quite original that you see it first time in the modern day Hollywood movies. Many will particularly feel sensational and emotional to see the human sacrifices, the near-death chasing sequences, and the struggling for survival of Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife with the baby labored in the flooding well while protecting another child of her from drowning. You see the strong wills of humans fighting for survival in helpless spaces, yet when facing the final moment of death, they bear no fear and are submissive to the choice of the nature and God's will.<br /><br />The movie also has excellent cinematography and directing. I suppose Mel Gibson is having too many enemies in Hollywood, otherwise I think this movie deserves more acclaims. Similar to "Passion of Christ", Mel Gibson proves once again that a movie can be great without understanding the spoken language (in this case, the Maya language), but just by reading the subtitles, or by the sheer images and sound.<br /><br />I barely remember the movie started with a Will Durant quote, saying "A civilization cannot be conquered without from within". Very true indeed. When looking at the human civilization today, we human species are still killing other people for our own good and for our selfish desires, albeit in more civilized manners. But after all, we could still be cold-blooded, savage and brutal. Wars, Poverty, Global Warming - all inflicted by our civilization. Who is to be conquered? The history will tell.
You'll be seeing a lot of reviews that will tear the film apart for it's inaccuracies, some people are "into that".  I did have to stifle myself when the Mayan Priests were startled by a Solar Eclipse.  COME ON, Mel.  The "Poison Arrow" frog is a toad painted yellow.  And the first Conquistadors arrived 500 years after the Mayan Empire had collapsed.  The film takes a lot of Creative License, but, aside from that, it's a great story.
mel gibson is a gifted director and made this movie bloody for a reason. if we didnt know how hard it was to be mayan at the time, the movie wouldnt be as inspiring
If you've never seen The Naked Prey with Cornel Wilde (1966) - get it, watch it. It is probably the most horrifically suspenseful chase film ever made. Apocalypto is the second. In The Naked Prey, Cornel Wilde is a white hunter in Africa whose client offends a native chief, and is therefore punished by the tribe by being turned into their prey. That is exactly what happens in Apocalypto, except that the prey is a South American indian that has been captured by a neighboring tribe and then released to be hunted. I have no doubt that Mel Gibson got his idea from that earlier film.<br /><br />Both films contain the victim and his party being captured unexpectedly; horrific scenes of torture of the members of his party; and the remaining victim being turned loose to be hunted like an animal. In The Naked Prey, the torture is a variety of inhumane and humiliating ends to the members of Wilde's hunting party. In Apocalypto, it is human sacrifice atop a Mayan ziggurat. In both films, the hero is saved for a special hunt in which he is the prey. But the hunters never expect an extended chase, and they certainly don't expect to be picked off one-by-one by their victim - but that's exactly what happens, and it makes for two very exciting films.<br /><br />Apocalypto is not for everyone. If you're squeamish, I would not recommend it. It is brutally real, disturbingly graphic and relentlessly intense - as is The Naked Prey. Also, it has subtitles - the Yucatan language, no less. But it is a very good story with an exceptional chase scene in the second half. It does not have a message - I don't care what Mel Gibson has said about declining civilizations and soldiers dying needlessly in Iraq. The Mayan civilization is not the subject of this film - merely its backdrop. Even the byline on the poster - "No one can outrun their destiny" - is misleading. This is not a film about destiny catching up with someone. If anything, it is about someone escaping a destiny imposed on him by other human beings.<br /><br />Apocalypto is a very simple story about a young man named Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his young family, who are members of a small tribe in the middle of the Yucatan jungle, that wake up one morning to find themselves being attacked and overwhelmed by a group of fellow-natives from a nearby Mayan city. The adult villagers that survive the attack are carried off in "chains," leaving the children behind to fend for themselves; but before his capture, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and young son in a cistern, promising to return for them.<br /><br />The captives are taken to a city that is full of activity, most of it strange and difficult to understand - like slaves working in a quarry, removing some kind of white powder, its dust making their bodies white. These white people look weird walking through the streets of the city carrying their baskets of white powder. Where are they going? Then we see: the white powder is being used to plaster the walls of their buildings.<br /><br />There are women whose hands are covered with blue paint, and they begin smearing it all over the bodies of the captives. "Why are they doing this to us?" the victims wonder. Then we see: as they are being led through a tunnel, there are drawings on its walls, paintings of blue people being sacrificed, being mutilated, being decapitated. Then they come out of the tunnel and see a great ziggurat surrounded by people that are "worshipping." On top of the ziggurat, priests are doing the things depicted on the tunnel walls. Once they've decapitated their victims, they roll their heads down the ziggurat steps as the worshippers cheer and a new batch of blue people are led to the top. Now Jaguar Paw and his friends know exactly why they have been brought here. Soon it will be their heads rolling down the steps.<br /><br />It is quite interesting to see a primitive and ancient civilization depicted in this way. It is quite disturbing to see evil depicted in this way. The Mayans were a primitive civilization - I don't care how much archaeologists decry Mel Gibson for emphasizing their blood-thirst and playing down their scientific and other achievements. I think he has hit the nail on the head as far as what these people were: pagan beasts. And yet, they were created in God's image. It shows how low man can sink in his depravity when he has turned his back on God. It also shows the horrors of slavery, and how a person can be reduced in mind, body and spirit when he is forced to submit to the will and whims of another human being.<br /><br />But there is a golden lining to this dark, nightmarish vision: one of the captives waiting to be sacrificed at the top of the ziggurat has hope. He remembers his pregnant wife and young son, and how they are depending on him. If he doesn't return to their village and remove them from the cistern, the next big rain will drown them. He knows he must live to help them. That is the real story. The rest is merely the hell from which he must escape, and the dogs of hell he must out-run.<br /><br />Besides Rudy Youngblood, Raoul Trujillo turns in a powerful performance as Zero Wolf, Jaguar Paw's nemesis. Because of the subtitles, dialog is kept to a minimum in this Mel Gibson - Farhad Safina script. Production values are high throughout, with art direction taking center stage. Then there is the location: even though the jungle is lush, even though it is lovely at times, jungle life is harsh and brutal. My favorite scenes occur on a raging river. There is also a very good scene featuring a beautiful jaguar.<br /><br />Michael Medved gave this film four stars out of four. I would give it five out of five. It is exceptional. But it is not for everyone. Nothing is romanticized in this film, nothing is idealized. It is hard, cold reality - jungle style.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith
If your looking for a romance movie or if you are an animal/human rights activist environmentalist watch something else, but if you like action/adventure pick this one up.  Otherwise, this movie was not too shabby.
This film grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the credits, it is unbelievably detailed, well-made and just all around great.  I suggest it for anyone who loved "Braveheart" as much as I did, the character in this film is just as virtuous.
or,<br />The Last of the Mohican Mayans<br />or,<br />1519: A Conquistador Odyssey<br /><br />On the plus side, the main character, Jaguar Paw, is likeable. Reunion of him with his wife and children is an effective and moving moment. Photography has many beautiful shots. At moments the film conveys some vague sense of authentically capturing the demented and eerie aspects of Mayan civilization. Action plot has nice escalation. Acting and direction are both good.<br /><br />My difficulties with the film: (1) Not that we really get to know Jaguar Paw in any great depth, but the other characters are completely two-dimensional; they are just so many cardboard cut outs to get blown away as in a shooting gallery. The two human sacrifices shown are even played a bit from the point of view of the crass spectators depicted in the film--just something to show for the adrenalin and shock value. At best, we might be invited to feel disgust for those participating, but hardly any sympathy or humanity of the victims. Mainly its just a sinister parody of open heart surgery followed by rolling heads. (2) While Mayan society, by mainstream accounts, was in decay as they were practicing human sacrifices, they were also in civil war, a point which the film curiously omits--in favor of presenting the Mayan populace as, well, a bunch of dolts.  Ok, so it's not supposed to be a documentary.  Yet the film is needlessly farfetched in reducing an entire civilization to idling nincompoops, investing their time and energy into nothing more than placating the tricks offered by a handful of bloodthirsty rainmaking frauds--who hire out to scavengers to trap innocent bystanders for sacrificial victims--frauds who while clever enough to deceive multitudes, can only stand there and look dumb if ever inconveniently faced with a natural occurrence such as a solar eclipse.  It's a bit like watching some twisted revival of 1930's Tarzan-movie-type racist portrayals of your generic, "natives," as a new and pretentious, "epic."  (3) The main character, though in a number of ways likable enough, is not so subtly presented as being favored--by some unnamed "force," Luke Skywalker style, as it were-yet also with absolutely no explanation as to why; it's just drummed into the audience ad nauseam, that he has somehow been arbitrarily picked to survive both Mayan depravity as well as the Mayans getting bumped off by the Spaniards.<br /><br />In a word, I can only describe these aspects of the film as "hokey." Relating them to the film's title, and reading between the lines, one might surmise some influence of Calvinist theology--where salvation is offered only to a few, rather than to all--but this would nevertheless seem completely extrinsic to the actual plot development. In this sense, given (1) and (2) the Spanish ships which appear at the end might as well be the monolith appearing to apes as in the beginning of `2001: A Space Odyssey.'  While the bewilderment of Jaguar Paw and his enemies was well directed and the scene effective--you do get the sense yourself of seeing something strange as for the first time, even though what was shown was familiar to the audience-one is no less led to wonder if the point of the scene, so to speak, is just to see Jaguar Paw as one of Kubrick's apes.  So in the end, it is not even clear, for the reasons just stated, that Jaguar Paw--though an outsider living in a small neighboring village-deserves any more respect than the other dolts in the film.<br /><br />The ambitious scope of the film is admirable, trying to give an eye-level view, as it were, of an ancient civilization, in its tragedy as well as in its humanity. However--though perhaps it could have been a good action flick in an unusual setting--the film just here winds up with too many irons in the fire, with even the action gratuitous and stilted.  The basic direction betrays the obvious talent of a skilled film maker, but its effectiveness is cut to ribbons by a hopelessly inane plot.
This film is PURE GENIUS and haunting in every sense of the word...everyone should see and own this movie.
It's hard not to enjoy this movie and be awed by it's depiction of the Mayan city right down to the blue smeared corpses at the bottom of a sacrificial pyramid.  If you particularly enjoyed the jungle chase wherein the villians hunting the hero meet their demise one by one, there's another movie you might like.  It's a somewhat racist classic called "The Naked Prey" from 1966 by Cornel Wilde.  A huge chunk of Apocalypto is a straight ripoff of this movie right down to the poor chap who is bitten by a snake and left behind by his mates.  This is the only thing that disappointed me about this otherwise excellent movie.  [...]
MEL GIBSON'S APOCALYPTO is a decent period piece. The costumes and sets, and scenery are great. The actors are very likable. The story is decent. It seems to teach something about ancient tribal life in South America, though many historical details have been protested against since the film was released. Although it is not as intense as I expected, it does have some nice family values displayed, among the main character and his family, which is an unexpected plus.<br /><br />The violence in APOCALYTPO is not as non-stop as I was led to believe from the hype and reviews when it was in theaters. Maybe I am too desensitized by more gratuitously violent films, like KILL BILL 1, (which I only saw once, due to it's wallowing in realistic cartoon violence, though it was a cleverly made film by Quentin Tarantino). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMEW">Kill Bill, Volume 1</a><br /><br />Compared to Mel Gibson's most successful masterpiece movie, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, the violence in APOCALYPTO is a lot less non-stop than in the movie about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ! Unfortunately, the action level in APOCALYPTO is a bit low, too. THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST did not need action, since it had very intense religious content. APOCALYPTO doesn't have any weighty religious subject matter to hold the audience's interest, so it really needs action to be entertaining. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHJQ">The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition)</a><br /><br />I thought APOCALYPTO was a Chase movie, but the chase doesn't really begin until the last 30 minutes of the film, though it is this movie's best part, and too quickly over, in my opinion.<br /><br />The film starts with 25 minutes of friendly village life, which is sometimes too contemporary, (in the way of dirty joke humor). This is distracting and takes away from the exotic mystery and feel of watching a primitive tribe, hundreds of years ago. In the Director's Commentary, they explain that these ancient people had a carnal language and disposition, even to the point of using the equivalent of the F-word, in the subtitles, at one point. Apparently Mel Gibson thought having the characters act coarse, doing dirty practical jokes, and cussing in the subtitles would make this film more accurate to the characters. If they say so, I guess, but I found it distracting until they explained this aspect of the film and writing.<br /><br />The bad guys are then introduced as fighting ensues, and then the middle bulk of the film is all marching through the jungle and arriving in an ancient South American city where human sacrifices are being conducted to appease their pagan god. This middle section of the film is okay, and they make it look interesting with the jungle scenery and the ancient city life, but it is low on action. It does manage to look and feel very exotic, which is entertaining and mysterious, though not too exciting.<br /><br />The best part of the film is when our hero breaks free and is chased through the jungle, back to his village, with the bad guys in hot pursuit, but now, unlike the long and slow march from the village, our hero is free from his bonds and can attempt to fight back at the bad guys. The run back to the village goes twice as fast as the march away, so it seems like the village wasn't that far away from the evil city, after all, and the chase seems to end too soon, because of that. It also makes it seem like a gap in logic that our hero's village never realized the danger of the violent citizens from the big city nearby!<br /><br />Many native, non-actors were used, and unfortunately it sometimes shows with the more minor characters, despite that most of the actors are very likable, many are not very good at hiding that they are, indeed, acting for a movie camera. If you have ever mugged into a home video camera, hamming it up for your friends and cracking up laughing after pretending to be serious, then you might recognize some of the actors doing that in quite a few scenes. They should be wearing a serious look for the whole scene, but instead they get a betraying, wide-eyed smile that they seem to be holding back, waiting for the director to yell "Cut!"<br /><br />There is a mildly controversial scene when characters witness the arrival of the white man on their shores, carrying the Christian cross to symbolize the arrival of Christianity (I suppose), and the natives run away from them, preferring the jungle over Christian civilization (as the controversy was stated). I don't mind this scene because, even though I can see how one could easily recognize this subtle message, I am not entirely convinced that an anti-Christian message is the intent of the scene. It could just as easily be about anti-western values, not just against Christian values. No mild controversy is warranted by this scene in my opinion. Actually, I think the scene makes perfect sense in that the natives are wary and suspicious of outsiders and foreigners, after all that they had gone through in APOCALYPTO, before this scene. So, to me, it seems more like a joke than a statement on multiculturalism. Whatever was meant or perceived, in the Director's Commentary Mel Gibson says this was the first scene that he envisioned before starting work on the film, and it was supposed to be like a funny incident that the bad guys are so surprised by the sight of the foreigners that they are immediately distracted from the chase!<br /><br />I think it is strange that Mel Gibson made this movie next, after his best, most famous and successful film, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. It seems to me that Mel got the wrong idea about why THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST was a huge hit. He seems to have thought that making an historical story, in a foreign land, using ancient languages, and including very graphic violence, was the "formula" for the success of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, instead of its great interest by Christians around the globe, who had never seen a film as intense as THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, as a Bible movie. I wish he would have made a prequel or sequel to THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST! Oh, well.<br /><br />The DVD bonuses are decent. Mel gives a good director's commentary track with his friend, the producer/co-writer, which is especially good in explaining the events and scenes in the big city and the rituals and activities of the ancient people. They say that the real life people were actually more violent than what is portrayed in the human sacrifices scene. The Making Of documentary is the usual stuff, but it is only about 30 minutes long. There is only one deleted scene, even though in the director's commentary Mel mentions that he shot a longer scene of a baby being taken from its mother in the village raid, but they thought it was too extreme, (for THIS movie, APOCALYPTO?).<br /><br />Overall, this film is pretty good entertainment, and it gets more enjoyable for me after going through the bonus features. Upon repeated viewings, I like the movie more and more.<br /><br />Some of the scenes and situations are actually pretty clever, classic type film situations, where the danger and stakes increase as fast as the time is running out to succeed!<br /><br />Many of my friends are lined up to borrow my DVD of APOCALYPTO, so that is worth buying this DVD for, too, since folks are curious about this film and it is fun to share with your friends!<br /><br />If you are intrigued by primitive tribal life in South America, I can recommend BEYOND THE GATES OF SPLENDOR on DVD, which is a documentary of a famous, real life murder of three Christian missionaries trying to evangelize a dangerous, primitive tribe in South America, in the 1950s. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XT8A6">Beyond the Gates of Splendor</a>
Viewing APOCALYPTO is a visual and visceral experience: some of the most beautiful cinematic depictions of skies, jungles, raging rivers and extraordinary recreations of Mayan temples and peoples fill the screen for a very long two and a half hours.  The images include excessive violence (beheadings, punjee stake traps, genocidal type destruction of a village of people, brutalized slaves, etc) and concentrate more on chases than on drama.  But the effect presented is richly colorful and imaginative.<br /><br />There is little story to tell.  A quiet and fearless tribe spends its time hunting, teasing a fellow tribesman about his infertility and making him the brunt of cruel jokes - just the ordinary camaraderie we are led to believe - until our main character Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) hears a shudder in the jungle that results in his tribe being overtaken by a more aggressive, human sacrificing tribe.  The village is burned, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and child in a well, and he and the remaining villagers are taken into slavery and marched to the Mayan capital where they are sacrificed by Mayan priests to appease the gods to save their crumbling empire.  A sun eclipse saves Jaguar Paw, he escapes, and after an interminable chase through the jungle reunites with his wife and children just as the Spanish conquistadors sail into harbor.<br /><br />The cast responds well to the direction of Mel Gibson.  Outstanding among them are of course Rudy Youngblood, Dalia Hern&aacute;ndez, Jonathan Brewer, Morris Birdyellowhead, Mar&iacute;a Isabel D&iacute;az, Espiridion Acosta Cache, Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias among others. But nearly as much credit goes to the costumer and hairpiece design (Mayes C. Rubeo) and to the set builders (Jay Aroesty) of the Mayan Temples.  Visually the movie is stunning though in a graphically gross sort of way.  The problem lies with the lack of significant information about the fall of the Mayan Empire, one of the more advanced civilizations known: Gibson would have us see only the brutal savagery of a highly sophisticated body of people. A sad depiction of a great nation.  Grady Harp, June 07
Mel Gibson is not may favorite actor, but as director I'm very pleased to recognize him as one of the best ones.  Apocalypto deserved to be an Oscar winner, it did not received any but at least was nominated for 3.  Also, received another 3 wins and 9 nominations.  It was well directed and unbelievable spoken in a dead language (I did not understand anything) but the movie is subtitled.  The movie is about a tribe that is exterminated by the Mayas.  Some of the survivors are sold as slaves and others were used for sacrifice.  The hero of the movie, gets to escape, but it's not easy, and this is when the movie gets more interesting.  I won't tell more, but the movie is so good that you just don't want it to end.  It may be very gore at moments, but is well presented.  The movie ends when the Mayas find the Spanish Galleons arriving to the costs, and It would be very nice to see the point of view of Mr. Gibson, if he continues the saga, so we can appreciate what happen to the Mayas when the Spanish colonist got to discover them.  10 stars for  the movie and 10 stars to Gibson as director and writer.
The amount of courage it took to produce this film staggers the imagination: you will not find any project in Hollywood that takes greater risks than this one.  I think it's fair to say that anyone going into this film is wondering what the bizarre and legendary Mayan civilization must have been like.  To me, the success of this work is obvious in the fact that so few reviewers remark that they just experienced an utterly alien world.  Only tourists come back from another continent with all sorts of "ooh-ahh" stories about what they saw: people who actually LIVE there see the whole experience as rather ordinary.  This as a testament to the incredible achievement of this film: the story is SO absorbing and the reproduction SO convincing that you completely forget that you've just witnessed the most complete recreation of the Mayan civilization ever attempted, just as many forgot that they saw actual *dinosaurs* in "Jurassic Park".  Instead, most walk out of the film nitpicking at the story, Mel Gibson's eccentricities and other mundane issues -- all possible because they completely took for granted the reality of a culture that couldn't even have been IMAGINED before the movie.  Ever see those Discovery Channel jungle guys with all the freaky piercings and tatoos?  Expect to walk out of the theater thinking of them as next door neighbors.  Ever gaze with wonder at jungle ridden ruins and the tantalizingly primitive drawings of Mayan life?  Expect to walk out thinking, "Bah... just another messed up third world country".<br /><br />Now that you've completely lost track of this film's true accomplishment, you are left to ponder its flaws as a work of art -- and such criticisms abound.  Yes, it is violent, and the humor is unusually crude, but the most shocking material is implied rather than than seen, and everything else is not much beyond your standard R-rated action fare.  Mr Gibson helps us identify with this bizarre and savage environment by completely throwing himself into the project, which means you will be bombarded with all your favorite cliches from "Braveheart", "Patriot" and "Passion": the reasonable man drawn to unreasonable extremes, the man's cuddly family, the throat slitting of his friend, a patient and long suffering wife, a pointlessly hateful enemy, a supporting cast who's obviously marked for death (mainly because they're constantly working SO HARD for your sympathy), heroes in agony turning their eyes beautifically towards the skies, squishy chopping sounds on bodies, wild-eyed enemies charging each other in slow motion, a sacrifice scene (aren't they supposed to yell "FREEEEDOMMMM"?) and an anachronism of over 500 years (i.e. the historical equivalent of having Columbus arrested and deported by the Office of Homeland Security).  Yes, you can easily smirk at all these cliches, but I don't think you can question that it is all done with ferocious artistry and passion.  I guess it all boils down to how you wish to experience this film: making fun of every excess you see, or just kicking back and letting it swoop you along.  Despite the simplest of action movie plots -- persecution, chase, and revenge -- "Apocalypto" does have thematic social criticism, a truly unexpected bonus when you consider how hard it is to identify with people from such a remote and bizarre setting.  Even though we cheer for our simple farming hero learning to overcome his fear, it is actually the decadent and crumbling Mayans that we are expected to identify with, for they serve as a dire warning to excesses of an American empire.
The trailers for APOCALYPTO made it look like a total blast, a real adrenaline rush.  And that's what this movie delivers...big time.  It is very action packed and exciting.  The scenes of atrocity and violence are delivered pretty unflinchingly (as Mel Gibson likes to do)...although there is nothing as lingeringly graphic as the flaying scene in PASSION OF THE CHRIST.  It's just good, R-rated violence.  The chase scenes (and the last third of the movie is basically one long chase scene) are extremely well filmed, edited and performed.  It is impossible to dismiss Gibson as a director...his sense of action and pace is pretty darn good.<br /><br />The basic story of APOCALYPTO (one tribe, more powerful and "advanced" than the other, attacks and brutalizes the other tribe.  Plucky survivor must escape and suffer much peril to save his beloved family) could almost have been set anywhere.  I can see it in the middle-ages, in the Old West, modern day, in the future, etc. etc.  But Gibson latched on to the latter-days of the Mayan culture, and it's a great choice.  Yes, I believe he's trying to make a statement of some sort about caring for the land, or the crumbling of civilization, etc...but I just really loved seeing this society.  There really haven't been any major movies set during this time.  I was a HUGE fan of the book "Aztec" by Gary Jennings a couple of decades ago...and this movie is the closest thing to an evocation of that book than anything else ever put on screen.  When the prisoners (our heroes) are taken to a Mayan city, the careful depiction of their journey, from the "suburbs" to a kind of skid row, through "factories" into the religious / political heart of the city is just breathtaking.  I don't know how accurate it is...but it is transporting in every way.  You get a very visceral sense of what life is like in this community.  The art direction, costumes and CGI landscapes are seamless and endlessly creative.<br /><br />I've read a number of reviews that say Gibson really dwells on the scenes of human sacrifice (heads rolling down the stairs of the pyramids, hearts cut from still living bodies, etc.).  Most of the reviewers that criticized the violence also disliked the film...or disliked Mel Gibson.  My honest take on it is this:  the human sacrifice scenes are somewhat graphic...but we never actually see things like beheadings.  We see the sword come down, but not making contact.  Then the head is held up and rolled down the stairs.  I've seen worse stuff on CSI!  It's well done...but unlike PASSION, Gibson doesn't feel he needs to show us every detail in slow-motion.  Yes, it is violent, but I frankly had expected even more wallowing, and it was not bad at all.  R-rated, yes...without question.  But hardly earth-shaking either.<br /><br />And let me again say that the climactic sequences, involving the chase through the jungles is fast-paced, frightening at times, scary, sometimes funny and always heart-pounding.  It is very modern, yet it's also nicely old-school...almost like a high-tech, modern, color version of an old movie serial...where one cliffhanger after another concluded each episode.<br /><br />To me and to my wife, this was a highly satisfying movie-going experience.  I think Oscar nominations are in order for art direction, costumes, cinematography and editing (at least).  I wasn't thrilled with Mel Gibson's recent shenanigans...but don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of this film just because Gibson is borderline psychotic!!  He's also a great filmmaker.  To me, this is one of the top 10 movies of the year.
Apocalypto is a reminder. Of who we really are. Of where we come from. Of where we're going. As we walk alongside Jaguar Paw into the Mayan city, past disease, decay, and delirium, we can see ourselves -- just another chapter in the sordid tale of man's inhumanity to man. Of course, our make up is a little different, and we mutilate our bodies differently, too. Even our human sacrifices are different; our victims tend to be pre-natal. And while our music and culture have a slightly different rhythm, we're every bit as ruthless, every bit the mob, every bit as deluded.<br /><br />If anyone had questions about Mel Gibson's directorial skills, they're answered here. Likewise, there's ample evidence of his infatuation with viscera, with explicit depictions of flesh being ripped, gouged, sliced, and chopped. It felt like an anatomy lesson at times, with everything from the reproductive tract to the circulatory system on display. I generally dislike gruesome scenes in life and in movies, but, frankly, these scenes serve a larger purpose in Gibson's films. He puts us face to face with mortality, the spurting, pulsing reality of our flesh and blood. The fact that we die. The fact that it isn't pretty. The fact, more importantly I think, of how and why we kill each other. We live in a brutal world, folks. Eat or be eaten. That's how it is, no matter how we insulate ourselves from it. Sure, Gibson has the camera linger for a beat or two beyond what may have been necessary, but there's no disputing the guy has an artist's vision. A bit of a torture artist, no doubt, but I'll take art like this over the standard movie theater junk that's out there any day of the week.<br /><br />Some viewers may have a hard time separating Apocalypto from events in Gibson's personal life. Too bad for them. I don't know what's in Gibson's heart. None of us do. Like all of us, he's got a bit of the bigot in him. Of course, put in the context of the hammering he got from folks who never even watched his last film, one might understand, slightly, the pathology of it. That's no excuse, of course, but human beings are strange, screwed up, and generally indefensible. Gibson's no exception. That, however, does not make his storytelling, and his insights, any less impressive.<br /><br />This is a fine film, a true meditation on the human condition, and a welcome respite from all those folks who see the world in black and white -- those, for example, who view the white Europeans as the murderous thugs who obliterated the peaceful Native Americans. The reality, of course, is that we're all brutal thugs, and skin color is no defense.<br /><br />I'm not sure, by the way, whether Gibson got the Mayans mixed up with the Aztecs. The Mayans were far less known for their human sacrifices, and it would be interesting to hear from academics on this. There are some other potential historical inaccuracies I won't go into so as to spare the spoilers. Frankly, the story rises above historical circumstance, so these questions ought not get in the way of the Gibson's powerful message.<br /><br />I'm not much of a religious man, but as I walked out of the theater, I couldn't help but offer a silent prayer of the countless men and women who have died and suffered unspeakable brutality at the hands of their brothers and sisters. Not just the tens (or maybe hundreds) of thousands of Mayans and Aztecs stripped from their lives and marched to their horrifying ends, but so many others -- holocausts only varying in scale, skin color, and ethnicity.
Set against the backdrop of a lush and lively jungle landscape, APOCALYPTO is a film about the death of an empire, the fall of a civilization, the salvation of a family, and one man's struggle against fear.  The film opens with a group of hunters from a small village chasing a tapir.  One of the leaders of the hunt is the protagonist of the film, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood).  As the hunters are preparing the meat to take back to the village they are approached by a group of refugees who wish to pass through the forest.  The strangers' village was decimated by warriors from the city of stone and they are traveling to a different place for a "new beginning" (apocalypto).  The next morning Jaguar Paw's village is attacked and invaded by the warriors who had destroyed the refugees' village.  Jaguar Paw hides his pregnant wife and young son in a hole, but he himself is taken captive.  The captives are brought to the city of stone and along the way a diseased-stricken girl prophesizes the destruction of the Mayan empire because of their sins:  slavery, human sacrifice, the raping of the Earth, etc.  In the city, the women captives are sold as slaves and the men are brought to a pyramid to be sacrificed.  Through a strange turn of events, Jaguar Paw's life is spared and he is able to escape.  Chased by a group of warriors filled with blood lust, he rushes through the jungle to rescue his family before the rains come to drown them.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO is one of the best films I have seen this year.  It is a violent film and there are some minor inaccuracies (especially in regards to some of the architecture of the city of stone).<br /><br />Also, the film is subtitled because the characters speak in a Mayan dialect.  Nevertheless, none of this takes away from the power of the film.<br /><br />The cinematography is amazing.  The people, animals, and vegetation seem almost three-dimensional.  The scenery in the film is more vivid than any nature documentary that I have ever seen.<br /><br />Then there's the acting.  The actors' performances are quite remarkable, especially considering the film's location and the challenge of speaking in an almost dead language.  The central characters are rich and deep.  Watching the movie, a person becomes entangled in their lives.  Much of that is because of the acting, but some of it is because of the writing and directing, too.<br /><br />The storytelling uses everything from the Biblical Book of Revelation and the story of the Tower of Babel to epic Greek poems such as THE ILLIAD to John Rambo in FIRST BLOOD as allusions and references to firmly cement the film in our own shared and inherited cultural heritage.  Whatever one may think about his past public indiscretions, Mel Gibson is a gifted and talented filmmaker that should not be ignored.<br /><br />The story is not only engaging, but it is a powerful parable, too.  We might not, yet, live in a culture and society that is as violent as the Mayans, but we are guilty of many of the same sins.  We enslave people by not paying them decent wages for the jobs they perform and by paying powerful executives money they don't deserve, we sacrifice our children upon an alter called choice, and we rape the Earth in almost the same ways as the urban Mayans do in APOCALYPTO.  Like the city-dwelling Mayans in the film, we often choose to not only ignore what we do but the consequences of those actions as well.  This chosen ignorance means little because the results of those actions remain, reminding us of our sin and folly.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO is a violent movie.  For example, men have their throats slit, people are beheaded, priests rip out peoples' hearts, heads literally roll down the stairs of a pyramid, and a man has his face chewed off by a jaguar.  It's all very bloody and slightly gory, yet it's not anywhere near as violent or gory as movies such as HOSTEL or SAW III.  Also, unlike those films the violence in APOCALYPTO isn't useless; it serves a purpose.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO is a grand film.  Containing magnificent acting, brilliant direction, and amazing cinematography, as well as a plot that serves as a powerful parable for our time, it is one of the best movies of 2006.
Apocalypto<br />Amazing movie. Just like they says never seen or made such a epic like this before! Beautiful shot, brilliant acting & cast. Everything from hit to toe is AMAZING!  Beware of ,Is very graphic bloody  & violent movie, just made for a guys & I loved it ..  Customs  & colors were gorgeous to look at.<br />Just didn't gave the 5 stars, They did and spend a lot money for this flick. Just wish the DVD release was with English DUB ;. Got me mad, had to reading the movie instead watching it! Subtitle is pain in the A**. Beside that, Great EPIC movie & Must see!
It's a well-made movie with a very interesting plot and plenty of twists and turns. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's another great film by Mel Gibson and ranks up there with The Passion and Braveheart.
This film is a welcomed change of pace from the typical plotless, mindless Hollywood flick charged with senseless sex scenes and high speed car/boat/plane chase scenes.  I'm glad a movie was finally released without including "Westerners" as actors.  An indigenous and Native American cast made the movie more authentic, and I would have been disappointed to see famous British actors or LA plastics with dark body paint cast as the main characters (see:  "Laurence of Arabia").  The film was action-packed but also soft and emotional.  Yes, there are historical inaccuracies.  However, most of us are not Mayanists and don't get hung up on these details, which take nothing away from the plot of the movie in the grand scheme of things.  Great movie, though not for young kids as the violence is gory.  I don't care what people say about subtitles; if you want to see a movie about Maya in ENGLISH because you're too lazy to read, you'd be missing out on the linguistic richness of the language (although the uvular stops, ejectives, and fricatives were missing) (see:  "Laurence of Arabia," again...).  There's always an element of fiction and historical inaccuracy in Hollywood, so sit down and enjoy the film and then afterwards read some good history books to get the real picture.
I love this movie..great film from long ago. It is a must see movie. Once you sit down you want to see all of it. The actors they choose for the movie did a great job. I have seen this movie so I had to get it.
It is too bad that Mel Gibson has an alcohol problem because he did an amazing job<br />with this movie.<br />It is beautifully shot and has such a great message.
As a first-time customer, I was more than satisfied with the sale and service.  It exceeded all of my preconceived expectations.  I expected to just be satisfied.  I was very happy to be wrong. The price was more than fair, and the ease of ordering was worry-free. The turnaround time was well within their projection.  I really enjoyed the experience.
A decent adventure film, by no means as bloody as Mayan history would lead one to expect.  But not complex -- most of the movie is a chase film.
The DVD came pretty quick (within 5 days) on free delivery.  It is a great movie... I loved it.
The thing I like best about this movie was its depiction of the Mayan city.  Gibson's people made a successful effort at demonstrating a civilization totally alien from our own.  I loved the strange women, almost aliens from outer space.  I also like the slave raid.  For thousands of years inhabitants of the Americas experienced similar raids by war parties from the "civilized" nations on the continent.<br /><br />The slaving scene, for those who wish to look "under the covers", is the history of civilization in general.  Up until only a couple of centuries ago, slavery was simply a given and was not regarded as wrong.  The difference in MesoAmerica was that many of the captives, rather than being used for slave labor, went to fattening pens and to heart sacrifice.<br /><br />I liked the relationship between the slave captain and his son when he tells him after the successful slave capture.  "Your doing a great job, boy.  I'm proud of you."  Wonderful, really, and all so very human.  The final scene was great.  The warring Indians look out to sea and watch strange men with helmets and breastplates rowing into shore.  It's the Apocalypse.  The world WILL change.  Ironically, this film ends up almost exactly where my two novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--start...the glorious, terrible Conquest of Mexico.<br /><br />I thought the chase scene, although exciting, was a little too much "Last of the Mohicans."  It was good in "Mohicans" but once is enough.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico, "Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"
What is this movie? It's pulp fiction--not the movie of that same name, but the type of adventure story found in the pulp magazines of the early Twentieth Century. It's Tarzan or Conan or Indiana Jones set in Sixteenth Century Central America--and as everyone else is pointing out, that's inaccurate history since the Mayan cities were abandoned centuries before the arrival of the Europeans--so historical accuracy is not actually important for this film, although a massive use of artists try to depict "Mayan" culture--250 make-up artists going full blast, no yet (and it's the make-up that really makes this movie) all working together to produce a couple of hours to dazzle the anthropologist-in-us-all for a fully loaded two hours. What a pleasure it is to see so much creativity at work on the details--these are the things you can do with a mega budget! 700 extras primped and flowered.<br /><br />As for the story, it's just pure plot, Hollywood-churn revenge and run to the finish action--Mel seems stuck in this concept of cinema--except this time, like the pulp stories, set in an exotic locale, and also like the pulp fiction, full of lucky, or not so lucky, coincidences and farfetched plot mechanisms that keep the action moving. Give the movie another hour and there'd probably be an earthquake or a hurricane thrown in somewhere and a crocodile or giant snake wrestle to keep things going. It's just paste, paste, and paste the right elements to get to the finish and then the Europeans are thrown in at the last moment simply to pretend this story has some greater significance than just an adrenalin thriller. There's no story here other than the standard big budget Hollywood standard. Too bad. Well, all the talent wasn't completely wasted this time. It was fun to watch most of the time and the behind the scenes feature shows how much thought the detailers put into their work.<br /><br />What's the message? "Do not be afraid, my son." Except when a panther is chasing you, then you better run like hell.<br /><br />If you are looking for attempts at historical accuracy about "Native" America, I strongly suggest, for one example, getting hold of a copy of Bruce Bereford's "Black Robe." It also uses actual dialects and makes a genuine attempt at telling an unbiased story that doesn't resort to the Hollywood cliches which "Apocalypto" is, unfortunately, chock full of. Who rules Maya-town? The box office rules Maya-town.
Despite the professional reviews on this movie, and Mel Gibson's behavior in the last few years, this is a terrific movie.
This is a good action movie. Plain and simple. I don't think it was the great historical movie that some said. It was basically Rambo in the jungle. It is an ultra violent movie by Mel Gibson... what a shock!
I am not a huge fan of movies with subtitles so I was hesitant to get this movie.  I watched it twice with in the first 3 days of purchasing it I enjoyed it so much.  The landscape is amazing and the movie in general is just well done, you feel like you are along for the ride the whole way.
Good movie. You really dont get a history review on it, but you can pretty much figure it out by the people.<br /><br />Pretty intense action. Starts off a little slow, but gains speed almost instantly. Some humor in the beginning.<br /><br />Its basically about a tribe that gets wiped out by another. One of the members is able to escape and make it back to his village to save his wife, son, and newborn baby that he tried to protect before he was captured.<br /><br />Great acting, great directing, highly recommend it.
I must say Apocalypto is a great film indeed and a class on its own. Its level of violence and some episodes make it occasionally reminiscent of Patriot, Braveheart and The Passion. And of course, there is in it Mel's un-PC, hard-core right-wing message that a man should protect his family. Brrrr!<br /><br />Any un-PC, hard-core right-winger will enjoy this film. LOL
Apocalypto  (DVD)<br /><br />The Mel Gibson directed movie Apocalypto is something like you've never seen before.  It gets you tired just watching it.<br /><br />The movie is about a young Indio warrior Jaguar's<br />Paw who is captured by Mayan slavers, lead by El Jefe and<br />- has his pregnant wife abandoned in a pit,<br />- while Jaguar's Paw is taken to the great Mayan city to be sacrificed<br />- they pass a village that has apparently been ravaged by smallpox,<br />- and they pass an old fellow with some type of laughing sickness.<br /><br />Note:  Many scholars believe the Mayan Empire was devastated by some type of Biological hazard they just don't know which one.<br /><br />Back to the human sacrifices:<br /><br /> -first they cut out the heart<br /> -then they chop off the heads and throw them down the steps,<br /> Then they throw the headless body down the steps.<br />Just as the Mayans are getting ready to cut Jaguar's Paw `s heart out there is a solar eclipse.  This they interpret as the Sun God being satiated.  And they take the prisoners to the gauntlet to run for their life.  Fortunately Jaguar's<br />Paw gets to go in the second pair and quickly see that he needs to weave as he runs, thereby making himself a harder target.<br /><br />Well wouldn't you know that he almost makes it.  Jaguar<br /><br />Paw manages to kill El Jefe's son, the finisher, and makes it to the<br /><br />jungle. Jaguar's Paw successfully runs the gauntlet, escapes from a black<br /><br />jaguar(I didn't know there was such an animal, jumps over a giant<br /><br /> cataract, throws a hornets nest at his enemies, his wife has a baby in<br /><br /> the flooded pit, and then just when he can't run any more and collapses...<br /><br />You'll just have to watch the movie to see the ending.<br /><br />Well worth watching ,but it is very bloody.<br /><br />Gunner  July, 2007
I never thought that I would ever be able to see a movie that brought Mayan history to life. Although I have had an oportunity to visit the pyramids in Mexico and Central America and have seen Discovery and History channels specials on Mayas and Aztecs I was always relatively disturbed that the TV specials had a lot of PC (political correctness) control over the production.<br /><br />Apocalyptico is an in your face depiction of the exteremely advance, intelligent and perverted bloodthirsty societies that both the Aztecs and the Mayans really were in their day. If I had any slight disappointment it would be that the city depicted in the movie, the temples, residences and most of all the pyramids were much much smaller than real life. I would guess that they couldn't film in some of the larger well known historical sites and had to build the set themselves. It does not take away from the movie but I only make this comment to emphasize the real horror of the Mayan history.<br /><br />This movie is so violent it's pornographic. The sexual abuse of the women is glossed over in this film, also to it's detriment cause I would guess Gibson probably thought enough with the violence that he will have to deal with never mind any explicit rapes etc.....<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />If you want to understand this culture then read 'Aztec Summer' by Gary Jennings, (not Aztec Bllod by the same author  ... the book is a dog). This is a novel with the most fabulously and for the most part historically correct depiction of the Aztecs, and of course to the same extent the Maya and their bloothirsty rituals.<br /><br />To give you an understanding, as you watch the sacrifices at the Mayan temple in this movie, the Aztecs did the same sacrifices when they conquered warring armies that they actually were killing people 24 hours a day for periods of more than 10 years!<br /><br />Finally, for those of us that have visual memories, the chase and the hunt does not diminish the impression of the sacrifices. It most certainly is not a film for the weak of heart or young people, and by that I meand under 30 for goodenss sakes.[...]
Mel Gibson's APOCALYPTO lives up to all the hype.  Long anticipated but frequently dismissed as "Gibson's Folly," the movie opened at #1 but ticket receipts quickly plummeted.  That's a pity,for while there are indeed a number of excellent films to choose from this holiday season, few of them are as good as this one.  Yes, it is violent--extremely violent.  But this is not the visceral near-pornography of a bad horror movie--the violence of APOCALYPTO serves a vision of cinematic artistry, and if certain scenes are not easy to watch, the film as a whole remains impossible to turn away from.<br /><br />Set in the ancient Mayan Empire on the brink of discovery by the white man, APOCALYPTO is the story of Jaguar Paw, a young hunter of the forest who is loving husband, father, and son.  He and his family and friends live peacefully in the depths of a great forest until the tranquility of their sheltered existence is pitilessly wiped out by a band of brutal marauders led by the bestial Zero Wolf.  Taken into captivity and brought to the city to be sacrificed to the Mayan gods, Jaguar Paw escapes into the dark jungle, determined to return to his wife and son and make a new beginning for themselves.  It is, like Joseph Conrad's immortal novella, a quest into the very heart of darkness, and Jaguar Paw and his world will never be the same again.<br /><br />Taut, engrossing, and incredibly thrilling, APOCALYPTO delivers on many levels.  As an action movie alone it is a success, but that ignores the thoughtfulness and care that has gone into the script and direction.  This is one of those stories that can perhaps be interpreted in many equally valid terms, and the parallels between the Babylonesque Mayan culture and our own are indeed frightening.  Gibson deserves much praise for his artistic vision--something few contemporary directors seem to have--but it would be a crime not to likewise praise his cast.  Rudy Youngblood is exceptional and empathetic as the benighted Jaguar Paw, and Dalia Hernandez is just as good as his young wife, whose own subplot of self-discovery, courage and faith is a vital element of the broader story.  Raoul Trujillo's Zero Wolf is one of the great villains of movie history, and to put it mildly you have to love to hate him.  The supporting players are well-rounded and handle their various roles believably and uniformly well--the cast as a whole may be unknown, but unknown or not, they're very good.<br /><br />Thriller, drama, social commentary--all these things and more, APOCALYPTO is a tribute to the power of story and its power to capture the essence of reality.  Certainly not for everyone, APOCALYPTO is at times painful to watch, and children definitely do not need to be exposed to it.  Even so, APOCALYPTO is a grand achievement, and impossible not to recommend to discerning adults.
First, let it be known that Mel's film is going to draw some unrelated flack and vindictive trashing from some critics due to the totally irresponsible anti-Semitic statements he made in a drunken stupor earlier this year. A groveling Mel has since begged forgiveness from the Jewish community, submitted to rehab, etc.<br /><br />Now to the movie. Apocalypto is an accomplishment of cinematography and a visual feast for the eyes, and yes there is unflinching, "I dare you to look away" violence. Some of the more juvenile comments from Mel-detractors have referred to these graphic moments of the film as "violence for violence sake" - utter non-sense because these scenes are neither ancillary nor prolific. The truth is that some portions of the Mayan culture practiced human sacrifice - how do you "soften up" such a startling fact? Well a director worth his / her sand doesn't, instead they portray the event with a reality that makes you feel that you are standing there actually witnessing these atrocities so that the viewer is impacted by the gravity of the situation. Each instance of violence in this movie is integral to establishing the ongoing story and immersing the viewer into the "reality" of the characters' world.<br /><br />What I appreciated most about this film is that the usual Western habit of casting indigenous people as "noble savages" was tossed aside in lieu of making the main protagonists three-dimensional. They exhibit the common traits of all humans - they laugh, joke, cry, play pranks...suffer infertility and nagging mother-in-laws. Though the acting from some of these novices was a little less than stellar, Mel does a great job of encouraging the viewer to care about these characters so that when they are threatened by impending danger and doom the audience finds itself holding its collective breath and hoping for the safety, rescue and triumph of these people.<br /><br />The close attention to detail further supports this movie - from the elaborate costumes to the language (the movie is subtitled) the careful research that went into capturing the time period and culture with integrity is more than evident and is quickly becoming a hallmark of a Mel Gibson film.<br /><br />I give this movie a solid A - it is the total package; coherent plot, worthy characters, action, love, sumptuous scenery, and a note worthy attention to detail that shows that the director truly cared about the subject matter. All of these qualities are more than appreciated in a day and age when expecting an actual plot to a movie is akin to requesting the director will his/her first born child to the audience.<br /><br />Hopefully Mel will work on capturing and neutralizing those inner demons of his so that he doesn't wreck what appears to be a budding and bright directing career with bad press.
I don't believe I have ever been disappointed with a Mel Gibson movie, but this one came close.  Like "The Passion", Gibson immerses the viewer in an epic tale and an exotic culture, complete with original languages and subtitles.  The visual beauty of the production is undeniable, and the human drama of the story is played out with stark, often gut-wrenching intensity.<br /><br />Counterbalancing these strengths is, in my opinion, a shallowness to the story and the main characters.  The indomitable spirit of Jaguar Paw is the key feature, coupled closely with his love for his wife and son.  These attributes are expressed by a defiance and tenacity both in battle and in capture, as well as in the seemingly endless pursuit sequence that dominates the second half of the movie and, quite frankly, gets more than a little old after about the first 20 or 30 minutes.  Yet on and on it drags until the final predictable defeat of the pursuers and rescue of his family.<br /><br />Overall I would rate this movie as definitely worth watching, both for the excellence of the production and the tragic drama it portrays.  I have no idea how much of the story is true to the history of Mayan civilization, but Gibson certainly paints a believable picture.  In short, Gibson had in his hands the materials for a great movie, but did not maximize the opportunity.
Mel Gibson does an awesome job showing how the Mayan's lived<br />back in the past.  I will cherish this show and cant wait<br />to show it to our recently adopted son from Guatemala(who is also<br />Mayan).  If you love watching shows about past lives, this movie<br />is for you.
Mel Gibson's "Apocalyto" follows one man's brutal journey in Mayan times from his quiet, peaceful village to hell and back again.<br /><br />The film has much going for it - excellent acting, makeup, costumes, production design, visual effects - which really makes you feel like you are there - but is let down by a cliched plot that contains a few too many coincidences.<br /><br />It is also extremely brutal and continues Gibson's obsession with human suffering following on from "Braveheart" and "The Passion of the Christ".
Following Passion, this movie is not something you want to view with young children.  Gibson has distinguished himself as a director/writer who is willing to show the unpleasant side of life.  I wondered going in how much plot it would have, the previews just showed a guy running around in a jungle.  I was really surprised how this film pulled me in.  If nothing else, I think it does an excellent job of showing how life was in the Mayan culture.  The barbaric cruelty and lack of respect for life made me appreciate living in civilized times.  The movie follows the span of just a few dramatic days of a young man living in a jungle village.  The first half of the film is outstanding.  It shows in meticulous detail how people survived and adapted in an incredibly harsh environment; to the point where I cared and saw how life was, although unpleasant, worth living.  Absolute barbarism is demonstrated not too far into it.  The character development is such that I hated to see this cruelty played out on people I felt I had started to know.  There were several points throughout that made me cringe.  A few even brought tears to my eyes.  As the movie progressed, however, I started having problems with it.  The prophecy by the young girl raised an eyebrow.  The solar eclipse raised two.  After that it was an inter-mix of concern for the characters (who faced a very uncertain fate) and laughable plot points.  It came to the point where I noted that even the waterfall scene was unrealistic (I'm no geography major, but I'm pretty sure there aren't a whole lot of major waterfalls within a mile or so of an ocean where this story takes place).  The ending was very "Lord of the Flies,"  and I wonder if Touchstone is paying royalties.  In the end, I would recommend that you check out this movie.  If you've read this far into my review you are interested enough to sit through it.  You won't be disappointed.  Empathize with the characters and try to experience for a few hours what life was like in that place and time.  Realize, however, that it becomes very "Indiana Jones" about half-way through, and anyone with an IQ over 100 is going to wonder what all the goofiness is about.  I'd recommend it as a rental, and Blu-ray is definately worth checking out (here's hoping the local Blockbuster starts carrying them so I can rent, not buy).  If you liked Passion and think you'll like this, pick it up.  You won't be disappointed if you buy it.  I'm not.
I have this movie on Blu-ray disk. Played this on my playstation 3 through a Sharp HD tv. The picture and sound is incredible. There is no doubting that the technology is a huge leap forward.<br /><br />The film itself it very good...but...<br /><br />You buy this film because you want a visually stunning film that takes you to a different place for a couple of hours. This film does this...but in a couple of places you find yourself wondering if they over edited or simple forgot to shoot for an additional 10 or 20 seconds, that would have made this a masterpiece.<br /><br />The important bits:<br /><br />1 - This is not historically accurate - but it's not designed be.<br /><br />2 - I recommend this film to everybody who can recognise great sights and sounds.<br /><br />3 - I will be buying more Blu-ray disks based on my experience with this one.
This movie is the exact same thing of the 1965 movie The Naked Prey. I said that this is the remake because it has the same action scenes and the same concept but on this movie instead of african tribes theses are mayans.<br /><br />Like The Naked Prey this movie is action-packed, it has a beautiful cinematography, great acting, foreing language and violence and bloodshed.<br /><br />Of course the story of Naked Prey is different because is about this hunter that goes to Africa to hunt down some elephants but then he gets caught by a cannibal native tribe, when he escape from the tribe he realize that he is now the prey of humans. Just like in this movie.<br /><br />When you see The Naked Prey you realize about the little differences but is basically the is the EXACT same thing!!! And let's not forget that this is not the first time that this ever happened! The Last Samurai in 2003 and The Departed in 2006 were also remakes of previous movies.<br /><br />P.S: This movie is very violent (even more than Naked Prey) so I can say that this movie is FREAKING COOOL!!!! YEEEAH!<br /><br />Adios.
Bravo Mel!!!!!! We were glued to our seats. Horriffic at times, poignant at others. Very original and visually stunning. No foul language or sex. Way to go. The brutality of the film is to be expected given the history of the Mayans. Sit back and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mel Gibson's Apocalypto.<br />The movie is great in the sense that it is something new. The characters are fun and intriguing to watch. One of the most realistic movies I have seen. But the final third of the movie was Hollywood textbook stuff. It has all been done before and we have seen it all in other movies such as The last of the Mohicans ( a jungle chase and the final duel ) Truth be told, I was waiting for the Europeans to arrive and add some intrigue ... :)<br /><br />But the scenes in the Maya cities were awesome. At that point, I was expecting great things from the movie. Everyone was dressed up. Great characters existed in everyone's mind. Even the Maya high priest was fearsome. At that moment, everyone was afraid. SPOILER AHEAD! - And then a solar eclipse! A highly improbable event. Within the space of ten minutes almost all of the characters are either killed or sacrificed without a struggle and those that remain are killed off in the remaining forty minutes through even more improbable events such as snake bites, traps and jaguars... I expected more at the end of the movie. Imagine the Europeans started killing off the Mayans in the city. A bloodbath, now that would have been interesting.
I would highly recommend watching this movie if you want to escape your every day routines. the movie is so different than any other out there- it shows a for most viwers a very unknown civilization, illustrates personal and societal struggle and also awakens basic human instincts in the viewer. I think that the movie definitely deserves even more attention than it already enjoys. It really catches the viewer!!!Thumbs up!!!
Saw it twice in the movies.  It was fast paced, funny at times, and exciting.  Never a dull moment.  Highly recommended and in my opinion the best film of 2006.
It is amazing how Mel Gibson directs movies.<br /><br />In my opinion...he is extremely amazing as a director!<br /><br />Its hard to swallow when watching some of the very graphic<br /><br />scenes.
"Apocalypto" is excellent! Mel Gibson's (known for directing "The Passion Of The Christ" (2004) & "Braveheart" (1995), for which he won an Best Director Oscar) directing is excellent! This is one of the best films of the year. The story and screenplay by Gibson & Farhad Safinia is excellent. The performances by two unknowns, Rudy Youngblood & Dalia Hernandez, are excellent. The music by James Horner (won the Oscar for his work for Best Original Score for "Titanic" (1997) is excellent. The cinematography by Dean Semler (who also did the cinematography to "We Were Soldiers" (2002), a movie Gibson starred in & also won the Oscar for his work on Kevin Costner's "Dances With Wolves" (1990) is excellent. The film editing by Kevin Stitt (who also did 3 movies that Gibson starred in, "Payback", "Lethal Weapon 4" (1998) & "Conspiracy Theory" (1997) & John Wright (who also film edited "The Passion Of The Christ") is excellent. The casting by Carla Hool is excellent. The production design by Thomas E. Sanders (who also did "Braveheart", "We Were Soldiers" & "Maverick" (1994), another film that Gibson starred in) is excellent. The art direction by Roberto Bonelli is excellent. The costume design by Mayes C. Rubeo is excellent. This is another bloody epic from the vision and the mind of Mel Gibson, but it is another excellent epic from the vision and the mind of Mel Gibson, who doesn't stop to amaze the audience. This is a visually sweeping epic that doesn't know when to quit.
Interesting as an attempt by an independently-minded star to step out and expand. I suspect the marketing department made their mark though - the title is odd; and what does 'No one can outrun their destiny' mean?<br /><br />This is set in Mayan territory in about what's we call 1600. Mel Gibson (who doesn't appear) presides over an explanatory video; he doesn't seem to realise there are many different types of 'jungle', but anyway he found a site he liked, flat enough to film in, with clear areas suited to building a Mayan-style pyramid complex and village. Both the jungle village, and the Mayan mini-town, are quite well realised though (sigh) marginally on the small side. There's another area, apparently for burning lime for mortar.<br /><br />The village is shown as idyllic with many practical jokes. For my taste the ethnic make-up didn't really look right, being mostly heterogeneous extras with brownish make-up. However, the lead Maya baddie had an impressive (prosthetic) beaked nose effect in profile. There's a good tapir hunt at the start, with a sudden-death gadget which slightly reminds me of a thing in 'Badlands'. Maybe it's inevitable, but there were suggestions of other film influences - an un-escapable pit (as in 'Silence of the Lambs'), a leap down a waterfall ('Butch Cassidy'), arrows and spears being tugged out (LotR style). The village life was well done - happy kids, cheerful healthy people, comfort, some communal things, fires, thatch, dancing - and throughout the film the scarification, tattoos, nose and ear jade pieces looked convincing and, like the colours throughout, were supposed to have been researched and accurate, as was the subtitled language. The dancing looked a bit under-choreographed to me, but you can't have everything.<br /><br />But we also have 'the universality of warfare and its oftentimes awesome savagery' and we have a scene with a very similar group, fleeing in dread. The village chief was not interested in asking them why they were fleeing - the forest is his, and fearlessness is right. (Come to think of it, the fleeing group didn't blurt out why - also a bit odd). Anyway - there follows quite a long scene of what looked like a massacre, but turned out to be a roundup of captives. This was slightly like a Vietnam War scene could have been, if filmmakers had independence and courage. It's surprising how easily a film can cause an emotional reaction: one of the overseers taking a group of captives, roped to a long stick, for their long march to town, was a sadistic type. Yeh - fall down the cliff too! The lead kidnapper had his clothing style worked on - there's a sort of Aztec/ Roman feel, plus animal skulls. We have a nod to worrying superstitions - a little girl with awful warnings.<br /><br />Then we have the town. It's well done, with interesting human types. I have to say the top of the pyramid, the rectangular platform, looked a bit small to me, as if an energetic desperate prisoner could have taken quite a few guards rolling down the steps. There are some impressive headpieces for the priests and (I think) the king. We have a sacrifice, complete with beating heart held aloft, removed with an obsidian knife. At this point we have a real stretch: a total eclipse of the sun, just before the hero is about to become heartless. It's not filmed very accurately - a partially-eclipsed sun can't be looked at directly, so there's just a chill and some oddly shaped shadows. Most films get implausible some time earlier. It's made clear that the killings aren't just being nasty. (Or - I thought this was another fact, or factoid - so that the priests could eat young women). The Maya are having problems, and hope a few deaths will appease the Gods.<br /><br />Anyway - the would-be victims are now to be disposed of. We have a pit with bodies, an open area, spears and arrows and stones, a corn field with genuine maize, a lot of running through jungle, and a waterfall. The lead baddy's feebler son - the daddy is obviously a bit disappointed in him - gets himself killed, which emotionally propels the chase of half a dozen Mayans against the remaining villager. We have death by snakebite, death by jaguar, a wasp nest, a poisonous frog blowpipe, and a repeat of the tapir wood stake trap. This is nicely done but not completely convincing: the pit of bodies would surely have been heaving with beetles, carnivores, and birds of prey. And the jungle was almost insect-free...<br /><br />Another stretch here is just related to the distances: I've no real experience running through jungle wearing not much clothing, but probably the town to the forest home might be about twenty miles. So surely they'd have some idea of what was happening... Anyway, there's the waterfall drop scene - a green screen job, surely - which the lead baddy emerges from holding his bow and arrows...<br /><br />A subplot is the hero's wife, and young son, who has a gash stitched with severed any heads, hidden in the well - which was dry, but now fills - we seem to get about 70 inches of rain in a few hours. She also gives birth underwater.<br /><br />And we get to the sea, presumably the Gulf of Mexico. By a standard convention, the two hunters and their prey all gawp at a sight they've never seen - three European ships, offloading white men in small boats. ...<br /><br />Three stars for originality.
Mel Gibson's feral little fever-dream "Apocalypto" is truly what you call heart-rending drama.<br /><br />No, silly! It's not a chick flick. I mean it's heart-rending if you're one of the prisoners that get hauled back to Tikal, painted bright blue, marched up the blood-soaked steps of some Mayan Temple, has his heart ripped out by the deranged & happy high priest of the Bat God, has his head lopped off, and for the cherry on top gets his headless corpses lobbed back down the ziggurat, way faster than he came up!<br /><br />APOCA-SHORTO REVIEW: if you're looking for immersive, bracing, & gorgeous, look no further than "Apocalypto", which convinced me American society is seriously missing that little something extra. That Little Something Extra being heart-ripping sacrifices. You know, for a good cause, like, uh, combating global warming. Check it out.<br /><br />APOCA-LONGO REVIEW: To ascend to the top of the blood-drenched, gore-caked stone steps of the cinematic ziggurat of zaniness that is Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto", it's necessary to step back a bit, take a deep breath, put down that enemy warrior's heart, drop the statue of Camazotz, and listen up: you gotta get down with Mad Mal first!<br /><br />What do I mean by that? I mean, quite simply, that Mel's work has always orbited, well, Mel. Each of us is a work in progress (except for liberals, who are spat forth pristine & perfect from their mama's hairpouch), but the fun thing about Mel Gibson is how we can relate the Man to his Movies. Consider the Evolution of Mel:<br /><br />Pulp Fiction Mel: the rangy, handsome Australian actor with a very identifiable Aussie accent, the lone wolf set against the arid, apocalyptic Outback of "Mad Max" and the "Road Warrior".<br /><br />Big Budget Mel: here Mel got some Jesus. Wait, that came later. Here, Mel got some Big Budget Hollywood. He played the Edgy, Crazy, Suicidal, Hair-Trigger .45-eating cop in "Lethal Weapon", ying to Danny Glover's yang. Happily Mel metamorphosed into something interesting, whereas Glover is know to whine about not being able to get a cab ride in Manhattan.<br /><br />Serious Actor Mel: Serious! Thespian! Mel! Yes! Mel walked the boards as the most somber Prince, which gave him some heft and gravitas---and set him on the weird, somber, intriguing art which catapulted him into the bosom of Quetzalcoatl---without forcing him to find himself balding, poor, and wrinkled, and still having to walk the boards as, I dunno, Polonius, at age 67.<br /><br />Director Mel: look, man, it's cool to be a Star: you've got, well I dunno, swimming pools. And Bel-Air. And 12-Martini lunches with production dudes. And mountains of coke on glass tables. And Spago! And LA's own Adam's Rib (for Stars): Star-Lets. But it gets old having to bow & scrape before old hairy (Jewish) crabby angry balding hideously wealthy (Jewish) movie producers.<br /><br />So Mel turned out the poigant "Man without a Face", blew everybody away with "Braveheart", and really switched it up with "Passion of the Christ", essentially a snuff film featuring Jesus. Word.<br /><br />Dead Languages Director Mel: Dead Languages=Serious Business. OK, I cheated. "Passion" counts here; so does 'Apocalypto'. I hear his next is gonna be shot using English in LA.<br /><br />And thus we come to MAD MEL yet again, only this time he's not walking the irradiated badlands of Australia firing shells at biker punks, but crawling and puking along the side of the Pacific Coast Highway, snarling epithets at Jews.<br /><br />Anyway, "Apocalypto" is Mad Mel as Montezuma's revenge! It's a gore-caked period piece chock full of hungry jaguars, nekkid chicks, nekkid ziggurats, nekkid high priests with old man bajoobalies, a wife in a well, a rugrat in a well, extra-curricular cruel contests on the Pelota fields, and blood sacrifice.<br /><br />It's even shot in ancient Mayan, which heightens the authenticity. I mean, imagine if Jaguar Paw was emoting in, say, San Fernando Valleyspeak? Wouldn't be the same. Besides, being shot in Mayan makes it more accessible to the largely Mayan audience watching it. Domo Arigato Mr. Apocalypto!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: it's an astonishing creation. For me, though, I think it was astonishing for the wrong reason: for hours thereafter I was in a kind of weird fugue or reverie, imagining myself clad in parrot feathers and a surplice of human ears and tongues, and a crown made of an ocelot's jaw, my body painted, an avatar of Camazotz, tearing out the hearts of my sacrifices!<br /><br />Sorry, where was I? Oh yeah, the story.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" tells the story of Jaguar Paw and his family, who live a life of near Edenic tranquility hunting the lands Paw's forefathers hunted for generations, until a bunch of nasty, smelly, greedy Jews come along and ruin everything!<br /><br />Just kidding. Actually, Paw & Fils get dragooned by a Mayan hunting party (who took the injunction "BYOB" to a whole new level) and frogmarched to Tikal for fun and games. Actually, very little fun. Or games. Primarily Death.<br /><br />And so we follow Jaguar Paw and his captured tribe to the great Mayan temple city, where the Mayans are living with each other, and the Earth Mother, in harmony, save for the occasional heart ripping sacrifice---ah, multiculturalism!---until a band of nasty, smelly, greedy Jews come along and ruin it for everybody.<br /><br />OK, kidding. Anyway, just like "Passion", "Apocalypto" is spare, brooding, beautiful, and complete in itself. Director Mel has some magic in his fingers & in his camera lens.<br /><br />And more to the point: Apocalypto demonstrates that while Man in the state of Nature may not be nasty, brutal & short, Man in the state of Civilization often means having to wear your Heart on your sleeve.<br /><br />Literally.<br /><br />JSG
Whether you like Mel Gibson or not, one has to admit that he, as a director, is one of the few names that will grab your attention completely when attached to a film.  I guarantee that both those people who love Mel and those who hate him know all there is to know about Apocalypto whether they have seen it or not.  And the sad thing is that a lot of people will not see this film simply because of who the director is, and that's a shame.<br /><br />I love Mel Gibson.  Braveheart might be the best film of the '90s.  Passion was one of the most raw, gutwrenching, unflinching films I have ever seen.  And Apocalypto follows those two films with another obscure yet applicable tale that only Mel Gibson could tell, and tell it so unbelievably well.<br /><br />At the beginning, we are introduced to Jaguar Paw, who lives in a small, peaceful village seemingly apart from the rest of the Mayan world.  On a hunt one morning, Jaguar Paw's group encounters a group of "refugees" in an extremely haunting sequence.  These refugees have obvious fear in their eyes, and only want to pass through the grounds to make a new beginning for themselves far away.  Shortly after this encounter, Jaguar Paw's village is attacked by a tribe of ruthless Mayans who seek to capture most members of the village for who knows what.  During the melee, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and son in a hole on the outskirts of the village before he is eventually captured.  Once Jaguar Paw is captured, we go on a journey with him to a disturbing, captivating vision of what the Mayan civilization had come to at its end times.  The journey to the Mayan city takes up most of the film, and encompasses most of the film's message, which could be taken many different ways.  After certain events have occurred in the city, the film turns into a massive chase sequence through the  Mayan jungle, and a final payoff/ambiguous ending that once again speaks clearly as to why Mel Gibson must be respected as a filmmaker.<br /><br />Apocalypto is a film that is not only drenched in its director's vision, but it is also helped immensely by the presence of that vision.  The brutality of some Mayan tribes must be present here to help us understand how bad it was, and the violence in the film does a lot to help us understand it.  By no means is the violence pointless, but it is extremely graphic and brutal; what else would we expect from Mel?<br /><br />I've read reviews about the film that say that Jaguar Paw is Jesus.  Some have said that it is Mel's statement against the war in Iraq.  Others have said it is a statement about our social culture.  The bottom line is that every viewer can have their own interpretation of the film, and that is what makes it so great.  Mel Gibson, as a director, demands that we think and interpret for ourselves.  As a viewer, you are being asked a lot to sit through this film.  It's all in subtitles to Mayan dialect.  The violence is brutal and disgusting to some.  The film is long, as is necessary for it to resolve its story through its own volition.<br /><br />One of the film's sequences will haunt me for a long time to come.  On the journey to the city, the captors and captives encounter a small girl who is infected with "the sickness."  As they pass the girl, and treat her like they would a diseased animal, her appearance/demeanor changes and she proceeds to give them a long, detailed, doom-filled prophecy.  This sequence is stunning, and absolutely haunting, for many reasons that can't even be explained.  It just needs to be experienced.<br /><br />So whether you like Mel Gibson or not, enjoy the experience of watching one of his films while you still can.
When Jaguar Paw (the lead character) was about to be sacrificed, he was saved by a total solar eclipse.  The Mayan high priest obviously knew something about eclipses, because he correctly predicted the sun god would re-emerge.  Anyone who has read National Geographic knows the Mayans were among the best astronomers, and their calendars were so precise they do not repeat for thousands of years (our Gregorian calendar repeats in six, if I'm not mistaken).<br /><br />Too bad the film's writers didn't have as much expertise.  With the sacrifice aborted, Jaguar Paw and Blunted were condemned to be dispatched out of sight of the public.  Jaguar Paw escapes into the forest, and during the night, there it was, a screamingly bright, large full moon.  The only problem; full moons and solar eclipses don't go together.  Solar eclipses occur when the moon is between the earth and the sun, therefore, the chances of a full moon the night after a solar eclipse are, zero.<br /><br />I also have a problem with the way the pursuing Indians pluck their arrows out of trees on the run, after they've missed Jaguar Paw.  I don't know if stone arrows can withstand that abuse.  You can probably shoot a flint arrow into a tree, but to yank it sideways while on a dead run would probably shatter the arrowhead.<br /><br />Otherwise, the film is OK.  It shows the Mayans in decline, and the barbarity they display is in proportion with that decline, which is pretty much what happened with other great civilizations (most famously, Rome).
Interesting setting for a story that is not new.  This time using a village of Mayas about the time of the Spanish arrival to, I am assuming, Mexico (Cancun perhaps?).  The peaceful village where everybody seems to be happy and where the men have hunted for generations, get their first inkling of trouble when a beraggled group of other Mayans seem anxious to get across the hunting grounds of the village.  Apparently they are fleeing from some unknown fierce enemy.<br /><br />That night as the village sleeps they are overrun by a band of outlaws who kill all who resist and truss up all others.  The main character of the village (they don't seem to have any names though one of the bad guys calls him "Almost") hides his pregnant wife in a deep hole along with his son.  He promises her he will be back to get them but is immediately captured by the baddies himself.<br /><br />The villagers are forced to march tied up.  The leader of the bad guys doesn't want any of them killed so the audience figures they are going to be sold into slavery.  As it turns out some will be sold as slaves while others will be sacrificed.<br /><br />When the main character escapes he is pursued by a horde of bad guys intent on killing him.  It is up to him to stay alive long enough and get back to where he left his wife and child before the oncoming rain will drown them.<br /><br />Why this is not a new tale, is because the way he is chased by the bad guys and how he deals with them, has been seen in many action flicks in the past.<br /><br />The movie is a good action tale and the use of subtitles is no problem.  Not quite five stars but pretty good.
The Fugitive and The Patriot mixed.  In the jungle, with jaguars and stuff.  And everyone is really pissed off throughout the movie.
I liked this movie. It did not not get too into history, romance, or anything other than a few days in a man's life.
A true cinematic achievement in costumes, makeup, and the overall recreation of an ancient setting is overshadowed by the orgiastic violence.  I almost did not make it through the movie.  If you are delighted by films like Saw and Hostel, you will love Apocalypto.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a Lord Of the Flies type hunt of a terrified tapir through the jungle, five youths hot on its heels.  The animal's death is horrific and not immediate.  A subsequent raid on a happy village is traumatic, with an infant being ripped from it's mother's arms and dangled like a doll.  Later, a human sacrifice has his heart ripped out and held aloft, still beating.  They don't just show it once, but twice, all from the terrified victim's p.o.v.  None of the characters except the main one, Jaguar Paw, are saved from slaughter.<br /><br />The costumes, makeup, Mayan language script, and the authentic pyramid show how much work went into making the movie.  Nothing like this was ever done before.  Gibson wanted to set the viewer right into another time.  It does have that feeling, but the first three-quarters are truly more a horror film than an action movie.  If you can make it through, the last quarter is a great action movie and the viewer can finally cheer.
Apocalypto is at times an energetic and kinetic chase film set in the jungles of Central America.  Worth a watch, and enjoyable for the most part, it does feature several drawbacks that hamper one's enjoyment of the film.  The first is that the movie is just too damn long.  It seems to take forever for Jaguar Paw and his fellow raiders to get to the top of the pyramid (right before the best-timed eclipse ever) so that the real meat of the movie can begin.  Character development is nice, but the journey to the pyramid seems to take forever and bad pacing never helps one's enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Even more annoying was the gigantic plot hole that made no sense to me whatsoever.  You see, before being captured Jaguar Paw lowered his wife and child down into a giant pit in the ground so that the rival tribe wouldn't kill/rape them.  About halfway through the movie the pit starts filling up with water, which the audience is supposed to view as a bad thing that increases tension and gives Jaguar Paw urgency to get back home.  Why?  The water should A. let his wife and child live longer, as it will allow them to drink and B. allow them to reach the surface when the pit fills all the way.  Instead we're supposed to believe they're in danger of drowning--why?  They live right near a river and the gulf of mexico: they know how to swim and how to tread water.  Sure it might make sleeping somewhat difficult, but they should be in no immediate danger whatsoever.  Poor writing by Gibson in what is otherwise an interesting, if somewhat poorly paced film
I loved this movie and had been waiting the majority of the year to see it. My heritage is Mexican and it was a big deal for me to finally see a respectable attempt to portray some of my ancestors on the big screen. I can't recall it ever having been done before. However, being a huge fan of movies, I know it's best to keep my expectations low. "Apocalypto" exceeded my expectations. It was classic Mel Gibson and having loved his other movies, I should've expected I would love this one as well. My only beef is that I keep reading reviews and moviegoers refer to the "mean Mayans" or the fantastic "Mayan city". It is true that the villagers who are captured are portraying Mayans but if the rest of the storyline is supposed to be representative of history then the warriors who captured them were Aztec, not Mayan. Now, anyone with basic knowledge of the Meso American civilizations will know that the Mayans were inspiration for many cultures that came to dominate later, borrowing ideas and so forth. I could've overlooked that if the addition of the Spaniards into the storyline didn't date this story as happening in about 1521. Cortes was not greeted by Mayans. Mayan civilization had already undergone it's collapse and the Aztec were the dominant force in MesoAmerica. Now, I don't know if it was a distinction I missed in the viewing the first time (I will see it again just because I loved it so much) or if it's merely all the reviewers who keep refering to everyone in the movie as having been Mayan. It may not be an inaccuracy in the movie but perhaps only a misunderstanding on the part of the audience? I don't know. But it bugs me. That being said, if more focus is brought to this subject over time then eventually I would hope that mainstream society would be more knowledgable about the truth and the fantastic contributions of Pre-colombian cultures. I'd highly recommend the book "1491" by Charles C. Mann as a good summary of all the most current theories of how expansive and sophisticated these societies truly were. Something else I loved about the movie were the political nuances portrayed in the eclipse scene. The elite of these societies were great astronomers and knew exactly what was happening during the eclipse. They used it to their advantage. I loved that Gibson shows that manipulation by the High Priest/royalty of the populace by making them believe that it was the sacrifices that had brought back the sun. As with most religions/governments around the world and throughout history, those in power are merely trying to stay in power by staging whatever show and manipulating the populace however they could. I love that Gibson includes this, but I wonder whether the audience picks up that it's meant that way. I want to emphasize that I loved this movie and I happily gloss over any inaccuracy because it is JUST a movie and Gibson more than makes up for any flaws with his effort to show the good and the bad side of humanity, the warmth and familial qualities of small communities with humor that is universally understood, contrast against the the darker side of humanity that every culture in the history of the world has it's own example of.
The quotation in this review's title captures, I think, the chief problem with this undeniably exciting but deeply flawed film. While there's no gainsaying the beautiful photography, the authentic costumes, the initial excitement of violent pillage and a hero's flight, or the reasonable acting Gibson gets from his assembled cast, the movie, ultimately, is pretty much just all action with very little meaning. Of course, one can lemon squeeze the opening Will Durant quotation for significance, but, after seeing the film, the epigraph seems more of a stretch than an insight clearly applicable. Surely it's no accident, therefore, that several reviewers here differ widely on how the Durant opener might fit the film, if it does so at all.<br /><br />Second, it's true that Gibson has commendable skills as an "action" director, and he does not shy away in this film from showing brutal sex (rapes, in this case) and bloody violence. Many critics, unjustly I think, complain about Gibson's penchant for violence, but they should be reminded that even their presumably favored art of the greatest merit has never been as "genteel" as they would have it be.  One has to think only of Homer's battles or of the stage littered with bodies in the last scene of "Hamlet," or the putting out on stage of Gloucester's eyes in "Lear." Great art (along with pulp fiction) has always been filled with sex and violence because we're interested in both. More of a real problem, which critics haven't focused on, is that "Apocalypto" suffers from the director's possibly having watched as a youth too many cliffhanger Saturday matinee serials. What begins in the film as an exciting flight of the good guy from the Mayan meanies after a while has so many hairbreadth escapes that not just people but probability itself is brutally bludgeoned, and the film, at least at the showing I attended, had audience members finally laughing in incredulity.
-- No spoilers --<br /><br />It can be argued that the events seen in "Apocalypto", involving only a few "story" days, are actually a condensed view of the stagnation, decline, and decay that occured in Mayan civilization over hundreds of years. If understood this way, the story seems less like an unlikely sequence of strangely unusual *consecutive* events and more like Mel Gibson probably intended it: that is, as a tragic symphony tightly focused on Pre-Columbian Mayan civilization. This amplified interpretation is borne out in the movie's vision -- encompassing at first only a microcosm of the lives of people in a small tribe, but then expanding to include views of the highest reaches of Mayan architecture, art, manufacturing and commerce, society, and, inhuman, superstitious brutality. For these reasons, if not for the exceptionally gifted actors (largely unknown to American audiences), ornate set-building and costuming, and seamless, skillful camerawork and directing, the movie is a bizarre, macabre masterpiece.<br /><br />Now for a few shortcomings...<br /><br />1. Look at "Language" for this DVD here at Amazon and you'll see "English", but the only spoken language throughout the entire movie is Yucatec Mayan. English can be selected for subtitles. These flow very naturally, however, and are not at all distracting or disappointing<br /><br />2. There is little in the Special Features that explores the whole topic of Mayan civilization, except for the skill with which the production company reproduced it for making the film. I can only hope that a 2-disk set is released soon that may include more of this information. Maybe this is a somewhat unfair criticism because the story, per se, is not intended to be a semester-long history course.<br /><br />3. There is almost nothing in the Special Features about the superb actors and actresses. Who are they? Who is Rudy Youngblood, besides being an amazing young actor? Where does the cast come from? How did they feel about the characters they portrayed?  There is a partial view from one English-speaking actor in a key role about these kinds of questions, and the commentary, although very short, was very instructive and enjoyable. Again, if there's a 2-disk set offered, we can hope there would be more material about the actors themselves.<br /><br />4. Deep wounds don't improve that quickly, and a solar eclipse takes much longer also. But, in keeping with the "symphony" concept I envision, a certain amount of "poetic license" is deserved by the movie's makers.<br /><br />Already I'm hoping that Mr. Gibson will consider a sequel, showing a stunning collision between European and Mayan/Aztec civilizations. The first parts of "Fire and Blood: A History of Mexico", by T. R. Fehrenbach would make excellent source material. If any movie maker in the world could do it, it would be Mel Gibson!
I saw this movie in the theatres and I must say I enjoyed the action. The movie has a very epic, sweeping feel.  I imagine a lot of this gets lost in the translation to Dvd but If watched on a good television with surround sound then it should be almost as moving.  Watching the first part of the movie reminded me a lot of the movie Conan the barbarian where Conan's family and village gets wiped out and Conan becomes a slave.  To be sure, it's not quite the same in this movie.  The young man and his friends are being taken to be sacrificed but the theme is similar.  Evil raiding parties that attack the peaceful villages.  The raiding party itself isn't that bad, judging just on their behavior.  They jsut seem to be following orders.  The only really evil one is the second in command of the raiding party, a sly tricky fellow who dubs the hero with the name 'almost' because he almost killed him but didn't.  He was probably my favorite character in the movie.  My second favorite character was the hero's brother, the slightly bumbling yet devoted husband who couldn't seem to get his wife pregnant who sacrifices himself so his brother can escape.<br /><br />  Anyway, thus begins a long march that takes the prisoners to the heart of the Mayan empire.  The main thing I took from the scenes in the city was the sense of decadence and lazy indulgence, which I guess was the point seeing this is about the fall of the Mayan civilization.  The last half of the movie with the young hero racing home to save his pregnant wife and son is the most 'action packed' part of the movie and reminds me of Rambo, the first one anyway with the hero setting clever traps that takes out his pursuer's.  Anyway, at the end of the movie Spanish ships appear signaling the end of civilization for the native people.  The idea being society wouldn't fall without being weakened by corruption and decadence.  It is a history lesson that has been repeated throughout time.<br /><br />  The movie has a lot of violence and gore but it's not really any worse than Braveheart, another Mel Gibson film. If you can handle that then you will find the viewing experience of this movie quite enlightening.  Also, as a side note the movie is in the Mayan language so it has a sort of 'foreign' quality to it.  I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes good movies...and is mature enough to stomach seeing people get decapitated and impaled.
gibson's previous historicals - braveheart, patriot, passion of the christ - the stories of these movies were well integrated with the period they represented - often linked with actual historical events - scottish warrior fighting england, american settler fighting british colonialists, jesus being tortured by the romans ...<br /><br />but the same cannot be said about apocalypto.<br /><br />how many movies have we seen of a male who returns from peril (abductment) to save his mate and child?<br /><br />you can simply take the plot of apocalypto and make it in our own modern times with little lost. and by that the movie loses its claim to greatness.<br /><br />it is a pity that gibson didn't do enough research to find a story more intimately wedded to the times and culture to give the plot its uniqueness and make it a great movie in all senses.<br /><br />apart from this the movie is highly entertaining.
The insensitive Mel Gibson, while devoid of many social graces is nonetheless an extremely talented director.  His captivating spectacle "Apocalypto" filmed in the lush, verdant jungles of Mexico, is a depiction of the clash of culture and civilization within the 15th century Mayan empire.  Filmed with a minimum of dialogue, the cinematographically stunning flick expresses it's points well.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw played by Rudy Youngblood, is a hunter in a forest dwelling hunting and gathering society in a peaceful jungle village.  His tribe's existense is shattered when a group of marauding warriors led by Zero Wolf played by Raul Trujillo, sack and pillage his village.  A large group of prisoners are restrained and taken on a dangerous journey to a great stone architected Yucatan city.  There they will toil as slaves or serve as human sacrifices for the gods.  Meanwhile Jaguar Paw had hidden his pregnant wife Seven and young son Turtles Run during the attack in a deep pit within a stone chasm and vowed to return to them.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw was chosen to be sacrificed and slathered in blue pigment to prepare him.  He gets a fortunate stay of execution by virtue of a previously foretold solar eclipse.<br /><br />He miraculously manages to escape, killing chief warrior Zero Wolf's son in the process.  This results in an exciting heart pounding pursuit through the jungle, reminiscent of the film "The Naked Prey", as Jaguar Paw heads back to his family.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the film, we see that although the Mayan civilization had commenced decaying from within, the truly acknowledged destroyers of this culture has begun to arrive, the Spanish conquistadors.
In relation to his film "Apocalypto," Mel Gibson is quoted as saying, "The precursors to a civilization that's going under are the same, time and time again ..." I completely understood this statement as I left the theater; no matter where you live, no matter what your circumstances in life, no matter how "civilized" or "primitive" a culture, a society is still vulnerable to decline. What makes all the difference is whether or not it comes from within. This is the very idea the film is founded on, focusing on two different tribes of the Mayan civilization engaged in conflict. It raises some questions: would the Ancient Mayans have continued to prosper had they not been in turmoil? Would they have been able to resist the Spanish invasion if they were united instead of divided? These underlying themes of change made this one of the most unique experiences I've had at the movies.<br /><br />The word "apocalypto" is derived from Greek, translating as "I reveal." Many things are appropriately revealed is this film, most notably the fact that the basic human instincts of survival, love, fear, and hatred are universal; despite the exotic locals and the intense action, I felt a connection with the main characters that transcended such details. The story primarily focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a young Mayan hunter living peacefully in a village with his pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandaz), and his little boy, Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Baez). One morning, the village is brutally invaded by a warrior tribe. It's a nasty sight to behold: women are beaten and raped; children are forcefully dragged away; more than a couple of throats are slit. The physically capable adults are bound together, ready to be taken back to the opposing tribe's village.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is one such captive. Luckily, he manages to save his wife and child by lowering them into a cave, one with many nooks and crannies for hiding. While the audience has no way of knowing how the situation will unfold, they still get the feeling that he knows he'll return for them. We certainly hope that that will be the case, especially when the opposing city is finally revealed. In this bustling metropolis: we see powder-coated slaves building massive structures; we see women being sold at auction; we see the men being painted blue; we see severed heads rolling down the steps of a looming pyramid serving as a sacrificial alter. Jaguar Paw is one of many captives scheduled for this fate, supposedly in the belief that their deaths will appease the gods and bring an end to a widespread famine. As he watches his companions' hearts being ripped out and heads being chopped off, he realizes something: he's not yet ready to go.<br /><br />Almost as soon as he comes to this realization, the solar eclipse darkens the sky, meaning that the gods' thirst for blood has been quenched (or so they would like to believe). Already, the more suspicious tribe members consider it the first sign of a prophecy, one described earlier by a little girl stricken with smallpox. This was the one scene in the entire film I had trouble understanding, despite the fact that it was a very effective scene; we first see her as a lonely soul who only wants some comfort. But after she's shunned for being ill, she starts spouting warnings as if she were a fortuneteller. She says that doom will follow the darkness of the sun, and that the man who runs with the jaguar will meet with a dark fate. I wondered whether or not this character was intended to be the creepy predictor of bad events; that seems a little too convenient for the plot.<br /><br />Still, she adds a nice touch of mystery to the story, and her warnings serve as perfect counterpoints to the inevitable chase sequence between Jaguar Paw and members of the rival tribe. At that point, the film becomes a full-blown action picture, full of heart pounding stunts and dangerous encounters (namely with a mother jaguar attempting to protect her cub). It's actually quite exciting to watch, considering Seven and Turtles Run are still waiting at the bottom of a cave. In order to reach his family, Jaguar Paw has to be quick, cunning, and merciless, pretty much to the point of becoming the enemy. Here's an interesting parallel: in order to return to the peaceful life he once knew, he has behave in ways that are anything but peaceful.<br /><br />Again, the theme of change is alluded to, and it's made implicitly clear by the arrival of the conquistador ships. Whether or not Jaguar Paw survives his ordeal, whether or not his family will pull through, it's obvious that nothing will ever be the same; it's a new beginning. Subtler images reinforce this idea, such as the birth of Jaguar Paw's second son in the midst of a flood (brought on by a torrential rainstorm). It seemed to me that "Apocalypto" was intentionally meant to be symbolic, with less attention devoted to story. But don't get the wrong idea; a definite story is being told. However, it's so basic that it's easily overshadowed by the thematic elements. At its core, it's a Daring Escape fable. But it's surrounded by a wealth of more complex ideas, specifically humanistic ones. This was a wise move on Mel Gibson's part; he's crafted a genuinely intriguing film, rich in detail and integrity.
This is just an interesting film to watch. With most people knowing little to nothing about the Mayan civilization, this film is an eye opener for just about everyone. The visuals, costumes, make-up, and acting are all so good you will often feel like you are watching actual history on film, rather than just another hollywood epic. Mel Gibson has crafted a movie that should be around come Oscar time, especially in the technical categories.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" opens with a quotation by the historian Will Durant that a great civilization cannot be conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within, and this thesis clearly informs Gibson's message, which is is that the native American empires were only ripe for conquest because they were morally decayed.  This moral message is not surprising considering Mel Gibson's religious views, even if it may seem ironic in a film that bathes the viewer in hours of sadistic and often gratuitous gore.  At the same time, Apocalypto is a fast paced action movie that is brilliantly filmed and well-acted.  While it is both narrow-minded and fundamentally inaccurate  to portray the great Mayan, Aztec or any other ancient civilizations as primarily war-mongering,  blood-lusting societies, sated only by the suffering they are able to inflict on innocent conquered peoples,  Gibson does manage, within this narrow focus, to make us feel the intense pain and suffering that has been the lot of much of humanity, and for that matter still is.  Some will take issue with the degree to which they are required to suspend disbelief in a movie filled with last minute chance escapes, miraculous coincidences, and apparently super-human endurance as the wounded main character is chased through the jungle in an attempt to escape and save his pregnant wife and child.  One could argue that the main plot and theme could have been preserved with less reliance on these devices, which may satisfy children, but which should make adults roll their eyes.  In the end, Gibson reaffirms his view that good will triumph over evil, with an ending that further confirms the theological roots of the movie's plot:  the prophecies are spoken and fulfilled,  the symbolic Eden of the Central American jungle is given renewed life as Adam and Eve are allowed to return to their Garden and "start a new beginning", while those infested with the satanic rot of a pagan civilization face destruction by an incoming Christian invasion.  Given the main thesis, Gibson apparently believes the European conquest was not only justified but probably divinely ordained.  In spite of its excesses,  Apolcalypto certainly has enough depth to warrant respect as not only entertainment, but as a piece of art.
Very original,probly the most original film I've seen.I was very surprised at how great this movie is,very good filmaking.Action,adventure beginning to end.Buy,watch,enjoy!
A village of hunter/gatherers in the primordial rain forest are savagely overwhelmed and either killed or captured by forces of the great "civilization" of the time, who lead the survivors back to their city to perform blood sacrifices to appease the mob and perpetuate a corrupted society on the verge of collapse.  One man escapes and races back through the jungle, with pursuers hot on his heels, in order to save the wife and child he had hidden before the attack.<br /><br />There are many ways this film could have been executed, most of them badly.  When I first heard Mel Gibson was making this film and had opted to have the dialogue in (I assume) the actual language of the people's with subtitles, it sounded nuts.  But Mel dared to do it and trusted his film-making craft to do the rest.  And he has succeeded in spades.<br /><br />A wild and intense chase film, done with astonishing skill and cleverness, amid the background of a thorougly imagined time and culture, it grabbed and held my interest throughout.  This is why I still go to the movies.  To be taken someplace in time and geography I could never see for myself.  It's also why I read books.<br /><br />First let me say I did not find the violence excessive.  I thought it was appropriate to the story and not overly dwelt upon.  Mel cuts away when he needs to, and he may have had an extra spray of blood or so, but I actually found more over-the-top violence in The Patriot, a movie Mel was in, but didn't direct.  I did think The Passion was too much, but I'm not reviewing that film. As another reviewer said the various CSI's on TV are sometimes gorier.<br /><br />What I found was a completely engaging film of imagined history, remarkable in its production values, and directed with energy and passion.  That you can draw inferences from the depiction of simple and gentle and all too human life in the village versus the excesses and corruption and degeneracy, albeit just as human, in the Mayan city, is only icing. Mel doesn't explain the reasons for their decline, he just presents it; there to think about at no extra cost.  And, a final irony regarding the clash of cultures rounds out the film's question as to what is truly civilized and what is savage.<br /><br />Many reviews I've read seem to be reviewing, or should I say reviling, Mel Gibson.  Gee, might his Malibu episode have something to do with that?  If we start judging artists works by their despicable personal behavior, we can begin emptying out the museums, libraries, art galleries, and film archives.  This film stands on its own terms, and it is a fine & daring piece of work.  Entertaining and with an added something else.
Haven't opened the product yet but I have seen the movie before and it is GREAT!!
I could have enjoyed this movie a lot more if the sound effects were shut out. An interesting and original topic which was filmed quite brilliantly but oh the sound track. Why or why if you wanted authenticity Mr Gibson did you not let the sound of the jungle and the village raids, etc. stand on their own? Are we viewers so dumb we need drums and other 'musical' sounds to understand the obvious? Just a point of clarity here - I thought that the sound of flutes were associated with the Incas just a few miles south of the Aztecs! Unfortunately the sound track spoilt what could have been a brilliant film for me. Why don't producers and directors keep these sound effects people in check? OK has some effects now and again but dialogue and good camera work is enough - the overt the top and inappropriate sounds are just not necessary
I really enjoyed the film. Sure it is violent--but such is the aspect of war. But there's a deeper message here in that the human spirit, especially when motivated by love, is perennially strong, as is the tendency for humans to slaughter. It is the extreme between the two that Apocalypto encapsulates in a brutally honest way. Of course many Mesoamerican cultures were brilliant and attained great engineering capacities--but showing the holistic nature of the human experience was Gibson's goal. Even today in the "civilized" and "modern" US, atrocities by our government included the use of slavery, Agent Orange, Tuskegee experiements, of weapons of mass destruction on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hitler, stalin, beheadings on TV, etc... Violence and peace, savagery and civility, are more intimate partners than we'd like to admit. Such is our brilliance and our downfall--this film is a warning, an allegory, for the human race overall. What really haunted me about the film, however, is the intense visual imagery. I was really transported into another place and time. The Yucatec dialect, the pyramids, the jade, the jungles, the characters, and the priests, and the emotional synergy borne from combining all the aforementioned dynamics simply blew my mind.
There are two features you can now expect from a Mel Gibson film:  It will be big, and and it will be bloody.  'Braveheart,' 'The Passion of Christ,' and, now 'Apocalypto' all are violent in epic proportions.  'Apocalypto' is startlingly savage.  This time we have the historical fiction presented with a happy Mayan village.  Complete with warriors and hunters we are given some colorful characters--not just from their face paint--including a misfit who isn't able to provide fertility.  One day they unsuspectingly come across another tribe--one that will provide menace for the sleeping village.  They are later raped and pillaged, and the survivors are shackled under a common yoke.  We find that they are brought to Mayan civilization where they will be made a sacrifice to their pagan god to appease all misfortune, including crop disasters.<br /><br />The presentation is certainly remarkable enough as the village hero, Jaguar's Paw, escapes on a harrowing journey that reminds one of the most urgent rendering of 'Lord of the Flies' that's yet to be presented.  The startling savagery comes to the fore with fearless detail.  The cinematography is masterful and their predicament is framed in every scene.  Some of the moon shots and New Age wind instrumentation is reminiscent of 'The Passion of Christ,' but 'Apocalypto' is a group project with a whole tribe in view--even if one hero is its focal point.  Anguish and a sweeping chase are skillfully presented in yet another Mel masterpiece.<br /><br />(Hollywood has presented two opposing viewpoints this year, whose contrast is a telling dichotomy.  There's 'The Da Vinci Code' and Professor Teabing's take that Constantine (an ancient and non-fiction historical figure) and Silas (a modern but fictional character) represent the strife and brutality that Christianity has dispensed in its two thousand year history.  And, then there's Mel's portrayal of one pagan civilization that was brutal until it was tamed by Spanish conquistadors.  A telling contrast.)
Arrived quickly...the disc skips in the first scene and freezes up but that could be an error from the manufacturer because the DVD arrived wrapped in plastic.
The seller sent the item in good time and it was as described in the advert.
The ONLY thing I knew about this movie when I sat down to see it (in the movie theater) was that it was made by Mel Gibson & that I couldn't get in to see it the night before (on opening night), was because it was already sold out ...<br /><br />& I knew when I watched the pre-movie-trailers that I was in trouble, because the trailers are always an indication of the type of movie that you're about to see ... (Eg. Kid-movie trailers when you're about to see a kid movie; romantic-comedy trailers when you're about to see a romantic comedy; religious-movie trailers when you're about to see a religious movie, etc.) & the pre-movie trailers were so incredibly dark & horrible (i.e. movies about serial killers, etc.), that I knew I'd better brace myself for an incredibly dark & horrible movie (which is admittedly NOT my type of movie) ...<br /><br />&, because I knew the only reason I went to see the movie was because Mel Gibson made it, I watched the whole disturbing, violent thing continually asking myself:<br /><br />"WHY did he make this movie?"<br /><br />& about halfway through, it occurred to me:<br /><br />Hmmm ...<br /><br />This movie certainly puts to rest once & for all the MYTH of the "noble savage" (i.e. the peaceful, wise & morally superior native) that is so popular amongst the media, academia & new-agey religionists these days ...<br /><br />& it also firmly puts to rest the idea that the Catholic/Christian missionaries did Mexico a horrible injustice by bringing Jesus to their land & (supposedly) "stripping away" their culture & religion ...<br /><br />Because, as cruel & bloody & vile as it is, this movie does a PERFECT job of showing what a world without Jesus is like:<br /><br />Cruel.<br /><br />Bloody.<br /><br />& vile.<br /><br />Not to mention demonic.<br /><br />(Yes, I said: "demonic.")<br /><br />Which is also why I kept thinking that this is exactly what the Baal-worshipping civilizations mentioned in the Bible must have looked like ...<br /><br />&, after watching the movie, I kept thinking about how I could NOT imagine being the one (i.e. a missionary) to wade into the middle of such a mess ...<br /><br />I mean, can you imagine? "Oh, there goes another head rolling down one of those lovely pyramids ... No big deal. All in a day's work." (ho hum)<br /><br />(NOT)<br /><br />So that's what I got out of it. And maybe that's not what Mel intended, but that IS the message that was screaming at me about halfway through the bloody thing &, at this point, I don't think I can look at it any other way.<br /><br />I mean,<br /><br />A) On the one hand, I hate violent movies & this one was completely disgusting on that count,<br /><br />& yet,<br /><br />B) It's brilliant the way it was put together, the way it fits into history & the overall point that it finally makes.<br /><br />And so, like it or not, I had to give it 5 stars.
The Most Violent? I don't get it? Do Mel Gibson films bring the most sheltered people out of the woodwork? The film had some violence and blood but not much more than millions of other action films. This film is no where near Robocop or Rambo I might add. Plus Passion of the Christ was a lot more bloody and violent. Is it just the context of the violence? It's okay for Jesus to bleed but not Mayans?<br /><br />This was a great film from start to finish. Lots of action, great storyline, thrilling, edge of your seat scenes...Highly recommended!
Credit to Gibson's vision.  However, when people rave about how brutal and violent a movie is, I expect brutal violence.  This film was neither brutal nor violent, considering the context.  It was extremely reserved compared to what it could have been.  I applaud Gibson's dedication to reality and using the original dialect, however, this tactic detracts from being able to adequately develop characters.  This is a film that should have been 90 minutes or 3 hours.  As it was, it should have been 90 minutes of action/drama.  I would have preferred a film that was 3 hours long that presented characters that I actually cared about.  How can I care whether a guy gets his heart cut out, if I don't even know anything about that character?  This film could have been so much more.  I was disappointed.
**SPOILER ALERT!! **SPOILER ALERT!!<br /><br />This is a work of art to be seen and appreciated depending on what you bring to the show. Google 'Guernica'. You may be moved  the art and choose to take off from that painting to study the Spanish Civil War....If you are a history buff, Mel may disappoint. If you are Roman Catholic, you may deeply sigh. As a pagan, you may even despair.<br /><br />As a Born-again, King James Bible-toting, Vietnam and Desert Storm Christian veteran for Kerry, I rejoice to see Mr. Gibson going through a major change in his life, as reflected in his new masterpiece.... We join him 'in camera' in the opening tracking shot, penetrating the dense rainforest (there are no subtitled or written narrative clues as to just where we are...) to join a hunt in progress. The last shot of the film shows the Jag Paw family disappearing into the jungle, while the camera stops after the last line about a 'new beginning'. We do not follow. The hero has survived the hunt; the hunters, having 'heard' the prophecy of a little girl, are drawn to their fate in a new faith, which will prove (to this day!) their undoing. Has Mel Gibson 'heard' of a new Way of life? Has he as it were 'begun again'? Has the 'hole in his soul' (the one-armed old man quoting the Owl during the fireside story) been finally filled? I am going to say that the prayers of a thousand filled souls have been answered. The overarching theme in this film, IMHO, is "Divine Providence": there is a supreme Being Who is in total control at all times in all places of the most intimate details of His creation. Read Isaiah 45.... The movie awaiting Mel Gibson now is the Old Testament epic heretofore unfilmable. It will take all the tools at our artists' disposal. It will be another timeless tale for all people. It will be the tale of Elijah, the prophet.
It just amazes me how it is possible to shoot a film that's longer than two hours with subtitles, with no - let alone stars - with no rather well-known actors, which would have you glued to your seat for all its length. Nothing's impossible for Mel Gibson I guess. I really like this transition of his to the director's path, and with four films behind his back he became one of the most notable contemporary directors like Clint Eastwood once did.<br /><br />It's amazing how Gibson can make a popular film but still deliver his idea to the audience. The scent of apocalypse didn't leave me during the whole movie and that's quite an achievement of the filmmakers. Today we used to think (and it's not for nothing) Maya civilization was one of the most developed one of the ancient world, Mayans were great architects, they had science, they had a calendar etc. And I repeat our thoughts on this didn't come just out of nowhere. Mayans were all that. But Apocalypto adds some coloration to the theme. The pyramids people admire today at the time of Mayan bloom were reddened with blood of those sacrificed for Mayan gods. Along with being quite civilized in today's terms, they had slavery and they killed ruthlessly. But this was the world back then. It was a time when death was a common thing, it was all around and no one actually paid attention. It was a time when war was all a grown up man could occupy himself with. Those were the rules. And this apocalyptic feeling appearing during the film is an ingenious Gibson's intent. It was the end of Mayan civilization and you can feel it. It was the civilization that killed itself from the inside with endless murder and cruelty. Spaniards just finished what Mayans started themselves. This is the apocalypse that takes place before our eyes - we see just a couple of days of life of a great people, but we can see its whole history in these couple of days.<br /><br />Of course Apocalypto is violent. I wouldn't say it's extremely violent but right to that extent to show us what was the everyday reality at that time. We see beheadings and hearts being ripped out at the top of a Mayan sacrifice temple, combat scenes that are even more graphic than those in Braveheart, less mass though. We see a huge pit just out of the city limits filled with bodies of people sacrificed... Sure all these scenes are not gratuitous. And miraculously you don't feel they offend you or they are out of place. If you take them within the whole story, attached to the time all the action takes place in, you start percepting them like they are quite natural. Like all this violence was natural for Maya people.<br /><br />Apocalypto is made this way so that you can fully experience everything that happens and feel like you are one of the people that lived at that period. When after the first hour of the film that predominantly took part in the forest I saw the Mayan city made of stone, I gasped along with the movie's characters who saw it for the first time in their lives.<br /><br />The second part of Apocalypto reminds some action movie, but still the picture doesn't fail to convey its message. If we look closer we see our society is not far from what Maya were. But the more they made it on the road of civilization the closer to the end they were. Looks quite nowdays to me. As it is said in the beginning (not sure if it's verbatim) - civilizations are not destroyed externally, they destroy themselves from the inside. And Gibson's film is quite a vivid example to this phrase.
****Spoilers****<br /><br />What a show this movie was.... it thrusts us into the spirit of the Ancient Maya, and restrains nothing in its telling of the tale, which is quite simple in itself.<br /><br />A young man, Jaguar Paw, with a pregnant wife and a young son, goes hunting Tapir for food in the forest, when they come across a horde of people passing through. They tell him their village was ravaged, and while the others listen and simply move on to the village resuming their lives, the encounter with these people haunts Jaguar Paw.<br /><br />Rightfully so, as a mere day later, the same people come and ravage his village. They attack the men, kill those who resist, and enslave all save the children, who they simply leave behind to follow their parents in tears until they cannot follow any longer.<br /><br />Along the way, a diseased young girl tells of a prophecy, in which a man of the Jaguar will bring about the doom of those slavers who listen to her, and all sorts of other omens such as "He who runs with the Jaguar".<br /><br />Enslaved, they are taken to a great city made of stone, where one by one the women are sold into slavery, and the men are taken to the top of a great temple to be sacrificed to the Gods, as these people fear that their Gods are displeased, and their end approaches.<br /><br />Just as Jaguar Paw is to be sacrificed, a solar eclipse takes place which the High Priest interprets as the Gods' satisfaction, and lets Jaguar Paw live.<br /><br />The slavers then take the remaining captives to an empty arena-like field, and release the captives two at a time, telling them to try to run away into the forests, while they shoot at them from behind with slings, arrows, and javelin, and with the son of the Chief acting as "Finisher" to kill the men as they attempt to crawl away, dying from their wounds.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is shot through the side by an arrow, and just as he is to be killed, his friend (who had been shot down earlier) attacks the Chief's son, and Jaguar Paw is able to break off the arrowhead and kill him with it, before running off into the jungle. The chief and his men chase him.<br /><br />They chase Jaguar Paw all throughout the jungles, and as they do, all of the diseased girl's prophecies come true. Jaguar Paw is being chased by a Jaguar whose cub he accidentally encountered and disrupted, and as one of the men catches up to Jaguar Paw, he is attacked and killed by the cat.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is running back to his village, as he has left his wife and child inside a deep stony cave in the ground to save them as the villagers are enslaved.<br /><br />One by one, he devises traps and weapons to kill his enemies, before he can rescue his wife. It begins to rain, and the hole is filling with water.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw kills all but two of the men, but is saved when he flees to the beach, and the two pursuers are frozen in their places, astonished at the sight of men in gigantic ships approaching the beach.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is able to flee and rescue his wife and child, where they retreat into the forest to find a new beginning...<br /><br />The plight of Jaguar Paw was very deeply human, and the acting was richly superb with light, but not sparse dialogue, and a gamut of emotions being run through all the characters, whose facial expressions and cries of anguish, pain, joy, or pleasure tell more than any amount of dialogue ever could. Along with the beautifully realistic jungle setting and cinematography, this is simply put, a masterpiece.<br /><br />It wasn't until recently that I became aware of the historical inaccuracies abound in this film, but this doesn't at all detract from the impact of this film.  After all, it's a personal story of one man's struggle to save his family.
this is a very good movie. very concentrated and intense. but when you watched the storyline unraveled, you  might have suddenly realized that you were watching the renewed 'rambo' from the '80s. even the fighting scenes, chasing sequences and the outcomes were almost the same. this is a well directed movie. forget about other viewers' yadayadayada, don't go too deep and try to interpret the meaning, historical or not, mel gibson or what. don't bother. just take it easy and watch it as an action packed, well developed, well directed, edited and most of all, well performed thriller. chopping heads, digging out hearts, mel gibson just threw the whole 9 yards to you, if you think it's too gross, too bloody, too cruel, just walk out and walk away. ever remember 'if you can't stand the heat, just get out of the kitchen'. this is what you have to remember all the time.<br /><br />why you have to burden yourself and try to seek anything meaningful out of every movie you've watched.<br /><br />this is just another version of 'rambo' in a different background, that's all.<br /><br />and, by the way, if mr. gibson likes it, he could develop this movie into a 007 or mission impossible like franchise, let the hero fight another day against the spaniards as a sequel, who knows.
"Apocalypto" is a stunning adventure film. Therefore, the more you can live in its reality moment to moment, vs. anticipating scenes described in a review or watched in a preview, the greater will be your enjoyment.<br /><br />My tip -- if you haven't already seen "Apocalypto" -- SEE this film. And buy the DVD when it comes out. THEN read Stephen Hunter's review in the Washington Post online. THEN enjoy these Amazon reviews and their richness of observation and updates on where Mayan scholarship takes us today.<br /><br />As others here have noted, my husband and I spent hours afterward discussing the film and what Gibson was trying to say about hunting and being hunted, and about a pre-Columbian world in its last moments before contact.<br /><br />We have visited Tulum, Coba, Chichen Itza and Edzna (I've been to Uxmal on my own), and of course read numerous articles about the Maya in "National Geographic" (which I call "Maya Geographic").<br /><br />If you have seen Tikal rising from the jungle, or Coba still partly submerged in jungle, you may be enthralled to see "Apocalypto" recreate a living Mayan city at the peak of its glory.<br /><br />My husband has many books about the Maya, including Bernal Diaz's amazing "The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico: 1517-1521." He also gave me John L. Stevens' "Incidents of Travel in the Yucatan."<br /><br />Both of these spur intriguing questions about parallel evolution, whereby the Maya independently created pyramids, astronomical measurements and other civilizational advancements without cultural contact with Egypt, Mesopotamia, etc.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see if "Apocalypto" drums up additional travel to the Yucatan and other areas where 6 million Maya live on today. It's quite stunning to see the faces and profiles of the actors, as well as their clothes and makeup, look so much like suddenly living visions of the glyphs carved on rock in numerous Maya sites. It's enough to make one gasp out loud.<br /><br />My husband noted two points about this film:  It's similarity to "The Naked Prey," and the possible unlikelihood of a forest-dwelling Maya not being familiar with the big cities, given the mobility and trade connections throughout the Yucatan. He still acknowledged it to be a heck of an action picture!
This is the first movie, either as an actor, or a producer/director that in my opinion Mel Gibson bombed out.  The movie is boring and a waste of money to purchase.  It's important that people know that the movie shows little about the ancient Mayan society.
This is the story of a Mayan who escapes captivity to return to the pregnant wife and son he has hidden in a well.  Usually it is the kind of story that I love but this movie seemed more interested in showing needless violence than in telling the story.<br /><br />There was a lot of hype for this movie, especially since this is the follow-up of Mel Gibson's incredible movie "The Passion".  But when the closing credits started rolling the person I was sitting next to asked, "What was the point of this?"  I could give no good answer.<br /><br />But in the heart of Mel's other movies (like Braveheart), the cinematography is amazing.  Even the story is fantastic but the end resolution left me a little bit in disbelief.  I'm still looking forward to more movies from Mel Gibson but in the end I wish I had just stayed home this time around.
After several hundred reviews, the movie has 4 stars out here in Amazon-ville.  I can't understand why so many people don't see the failed potential of this movie.  Gratuitous primitive slaughter and terror for the bulk of a movie is appealing?  You don't need a solid story?  Where's the discriminating viewer here?  It reminds me of Rome, where the citizens were more interested in seeing people ripped apart by gladiators than the welfare of their state.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but Mel Gibson is capable of so much more.  He's a VERY talented actor and director.  Why oh why did he let this possible gem become a pile of decaying bodies?  When you have such a huge budget and a cadre of talented people, you need to be responsible to produce something worthwhile.<br /><br />I won't recap what the story is about--that's been done many times over so that won't be helpful.  Where this movie fails is in providing a full story cycle that is believable.  The story is very brief, but drags on, fixated on repetitive themes of terror.  And there are so many scenes that are unbelievable.<br /><br />What really shines in this movie is the revival of Mayan speech and dialect.  It is astoundingly convincing and I think Gibson could have leveraged this more, given the amount of work involved by the actors.  Also, the costumes are amazing--Mayes Rubeo did a fabulous job.  The mannerisms of the characters are a little too modern for what I find believable, especially the facial expressions of lead antagonist head-hunter.<br /><br />There are several things I believe Gibson should have done, that would have made this movie spectacular:<br /><br />*** NOTE: Spoilers follow ***<br /><br />1) More time on the peaceful village, giving us an opportunity to get a better sense of how these people lived and interacted between their groups.<br /><br />2) More time on the Mayan temple city.  The Mayans achieved some amazing feats of invention, despite their bloodthirsty rituals.  Instead we were given only a showing of an insane group of lunatics hell bent on slavery and sacrifice.<br /><br />3) The overall theme presented is "advanced Mayan city seeks out their primitive neighbors living in the forest and annexes them to their way of life, featuring slavery and sacrifices".  Sure, OK--show some sacrifices.  But also show what happens to the newly captured people when first enslaved.  How do they manage to survive?  What of the people already there--what do they learn from them?  Is there any hope of escape?<br /><br />4) Do away with senseless implausibility:<br /><br />* The forest chase was mostly linear.  I'm sorry, but Jaguar Paw demonstrated the intelligence to serpentine when running across the dirt field to avoid arrows from his captors.  Why would he not choose to deviate from his straight path of flight in an area where there would be minimal signs of his maneuvering?  Surely he knows the terrain very well... there must be alternate routes back to the pit where his wife remained.  Also, the villains pursued him without any preparation... yet when nightfall came, they suddenly have torches?<br />* Jaguar Paw was hit by two arrows.  The nature of his wounds would NOT have let him revive in such a short time and be able to run for hours on end--this was quite ridiculous.  He was also starved and without water for days.  He would NOT have had the energy to run like that, even discounting his wounds.<br />* Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife was subjected to physical blows that would have easily caused serious harm to the baby--I'm surprised she gave birth so effortlessly and to a very healthy baby.  Also, she'd be far too heavy being pregnant to even try raising herself out of that pit.  I'd expect the pit would've been stocked with some tools and at least a means of climbing up several feet to avoid drowning when the rains would come (obviously known, judging from her husband's reaction to the threat of rain).  She could've sustained herself and her son by killing and eating a few creatures that fall into the pit, so that her husband could be away longer without cutting into the plausibility of her survival.<br />* A lunar eclipse does not come and go in a matter of a few minutes.  This was an absurd violation of the laws of physics and looked quite comical.  Of course this was a vehicle to save Jaguar Paw from certain death.  But there could have been other more imaginative ways to do it.<br />* A pile of rotting bodies would not look so nearly fresh.  Given the number, this is more than the day's sacrifices.  We see mostly intact bodies (save the heads) strewn all over the landscape, covered with grime but lacking torn or rotting flesh.  We hear the buzz of flies... but where are the birds and other animals that would normally scavenge on this?  Also, the stench would be unbearable as Jaguar Paw landed on top of the pile.  He showed no reaction to that horrid smell.<br />* The poisonous frog--great idea, but he prepared only three thorns?  Certainly this would be a very effective weapon (discounting the poor aim from a rolled leaf tube) as was proved.  Why not grab a bunch of thorns (at least 9) and flee with the frog in hand, so that he'd have more time elsewhere to create his ammunition?<br /><br />5) Less time on the chase.  It really went on far too long, to measure up to the sustainability of Jaguar Paw's flight.<br /><br />6) The arrival of the Spaniards was a blatant mistake on the timeline of this civilization.  I would have expected a small fleet of boats from a sea faring tribe having arrived.  The effect would have been enough and definitely plausible, clearly showing how the peaceful forest people were falling behind other groups--the captors having a city of architected buildings and a sea faring tribe with capable vessels.<br /><br />We were left with the bulk of the movie focused on brutal terror and a long improbable chase against impossible odds.  Sure, there was a certain thrill to being uncertain of how it would all turn out.  But in the end, it was hollow entertainment.  The movie definitely needs more substance.  What a shame, given the enormous budget.  :-/<br /><br />So there you have it... if you're got a couple of hours to kill and you want to watch some convincing primitive terror, here's the movie for you.  If you're curious about Mayan history and what that civilization was like, this is but a very narrow glimpse that is misleading.  I'd move on and watch something else.
I can't help but wonder if Mel Gibson realized he was recreating Rambo: First Blood.<br /><br />No, really, I loved the movie, but it's Rambo.  Guy just wants to mind his own business, gets abused by The Man (they drew first blood!), escapes and turns his greater knowledge of forest/jungle warfare to his favor despite being outnumbered and poorly equipped.<br /><br />I have just described Apocalypto AND Rambo.<br /><br />If you were wavering on whether to buy this movie or not, just ask yourself, "Did I like Rambo?"  Of course you did.  Everyone likes Rambo.  Quit pretendin'.  And you'll like Apocalypto too, cause it's Rambo.<br /><br />(Although, interestingly, Apocalypto has way more gore in it than all of the Rambo movies combined.)
Fundamentally, it turns into a revenge film which keeps me from giving it 5 stars & Gibson is certainly a sadist who has a god/martyr complex but he deserves great credit for bring this "history" to the screen.  And the fact it's in a native language is key - I hope hollywood starts making all period pieces in their native language - I hate hearing english in a film when it's ridiculous.  I highly recommend Rapa Nui if you liked this film - it's actually a much better story but with "english speaking characters.  Please, Mel, remake Rapa in it's native tong with native actors!!  It would be THE perfect cautionary tail.
Great Features. Too bad Mel had to go on his anti semitic rant just before this Film dropped. Most slept-on movie of the year.<br /><br />Blu-Ray looks amazing, so buy that over this DVD one.
I just finished watching this movie. If you like a lot of violence for violence sake, it was OK. But, I thought the movie and all the hype, was over rated. You would actually have to watch it a few times to figure out who some of the characters are. I would suggest borrowing it, before buying.
I was very impressed by the producers' attention to detail to provide authenticity to this motion picture.  Therefore, I was shocked by the ending when the Spaniards arrived 400 years too early.  I find it hard to believe that the producers to go to such extraordinary detail in the production only to ruin it with an anachronistic ending.  What were they thinking?  Perhaps, their opinion of the average viewer was so low that they thought no one would catch the historical error.
The Maya civilization ceased to exist before the coming of the Europeans, what would have been a decent movie was ruined by placing the Europeans in that time period thereby suggesting that the Europeans played a part in the Mayan civilization demise.
This film was incredible, and any naysayers should have their heads rolled down a Mayan pyramid (scene in movie) to hopefully have some sense knocked into them.  Yes, Mel is controversial, but so is Woody Allen and critics still herald him as a genius.  And Yes it is terribly violent and not historically accurate, so what! It's still haunting, exciting, mystical, scary, depressing, fascinating, and beautiful. Stop looking for more reasons to hate Mel Gibson and accept the fact that he's pretty f**ing good at what he does.<br />watch it!!
I liked this film.  I had waited to watch it, put off a bit by several reviews talking about how gory it was.  When I finally did watch it I was surprised that it was less gratuitously violent that I'd imagined.  Sure there was blood, fighting, violence, but just as to fit the story line.  I actually thought "Braveheart" to be more stomach churning.  I'm not going to repeat what's been said in other reviews, but if you are leery of watching it for the blood and violence may I suggest watching it with the audio commentary "on".  It takes some sting out of it, as Gibson and Safinia set the stage and talk about the actors and technical details and how much they enjoyed making the film.  My favorite comment was from Gibson, talking about the scene where a jaguar is chasing Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and Gibson points out that it really was a jaguar and he really was chasing Youngblood and there was no danger ... pause ... "well ... unless he tripped".  He's was, of course, only kidding.
Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" is not a normal movie but a big make-up movie...<br /><br />From the moment the film starts to the moment it ends you feel you are transported into the ancient Mayan civilization, seeing full body tattoos, body art, multiple piercing and jewelry... It is a very exciting motion picture to look at, so strange to watch... It has the esthetic that began to appeal and it fills you with wonder...<br /><br />Our hero Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a cunning hunter whose father requests him not to tell of what he saw in forest today... He is warned to strike fear from his heart and not to bring it into the village...His wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez) is pregnant, and their small son, Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Baez), live modestly in a village surrounded by a tranquil rain forest...<br /><br />After a night of frivolity, the peaceful existence of this small community of hunters collapses when savage outsiders begin torching and burning everything in sight killing most and taking away dozens left...<br /><br />Going undetected, Jaguar Paw hides his wife and child in a deep, waterless well promising to return when the attack has passed... However when he is captured by his fearsome aggressors, he is tied to a pole and marched with his friends and fellow villagers to a forsaken land, stone-built, where the earth bleeds...<br /><br />A fortuitous switch provides Jaguar Paw with an unexpected opportunity to escape and get back to his family in peril... But for that he has to make his way home through a killing field and a dangerous jungle, racing against sadistic captors hot on his trail...<br /><br />"Apocalypto" transports the viewers to a strange and unreachable world, to a civilization in decline, to an infernal vision of a city and its inhabitants, to shocking images of human barbarism which has always existed throughout the ages...
I did not see this movie when it first came out because the reviews and controversy turned me off.  I just saw it on cable for the first time and was blown away.  I like movies that interest me in a new topic, and so now I am reading about the history of the Mayan civilization.  Mel Gibson is to be commended for rising above the abysmal product that normally comes out of Hollywood.  All the detail makes it extremely believable and transports the viewer back to the time.  I am a fan of "The Naked Prey", so the final scenes were really enjoyable.  I cannot understand why this movie did not win more accolades.  What were the winning movies in 2006 anyway?<br />Mr. Gibson has done a remarkable job with this film.<br />I researched and found that "The Departed" won the best picture that year.  I saw this on cable and it was really not worth watching.  I cannot figure out how the Academy could overlook Apocalypto and nominate "Babel," for instance.  Raoul Trujillo was so frightening as "Zero Wolf" that I had nightmares for days afterwards.  He was outstanding !!
An enjoyable aspect of Mel Gibson's Apocolypto is that it is not your typical action film. It boasts no real big star names, and doesn't fall in love with itself like some films do. It simply tells a story. It could have been just another brainless action flick, but instead strives to illustrate the essence of one man's attempts at survival while using a Mayan civilization as the setting.  One tribe's fate is in jeopardy when the unthinkable happens: they become enslaved and the targets of a ritual sacrifice.<br /><br />To get this point over with, the movie is quite grisly, barbaric, graphic or whatever other word which successfully describes a lot of blood and death. There are scenes of some of Jaguar Paw's fellow tribesmen being beheaded, as well as many scenes of warriors being speared, impaled or killed in various other ways. There are even scenes of corpses rotting. I'm not one who relishes the idea of watching this type of thing, but I don't think that the barbarism in the film debunks the real story at hand. Another way to say this is: there is a point to the violence, and it in no way effects or tries to "steal the show" of the film's real essence: the struggle of Jaguar Paw (and others) to escape and get back to their land.<br /><br />What Gibson is able to achieve in many parts of this film is a fast-paced, yet mysterious and eerie atmosphere. There are moments, like at the film's beginning, when the quiet tranquility of the tribe's home is juxtaposed by the intrusion and ruthlessness of the other clan. There are also moments when Jaguar Paw is frantically running for his life in the brush, and then moments where he is quietly hiding with others hunting within feet of him, using his instincts as a warrior for escape. Also, the scenery of the forest really intensifies the feeling of the unknown, or danger lurking just beyond the next step. There are many chase scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, and you feel yourself rooting for Jaguar Paw to make it back to his wife and kid as the rain starts pouring.<br /><br />If you can forgive Gibson for his shady reputation and just take in this film, I think you will find his film quite original, and scenery impressive for the film's mood. It was refreshing to see a film that tries to be different, original and a little bit intelligent to boot, something you seldom see in action films anymore.
After The Passion, I was hoping Mel Gibson would spend the rest of his life redoing Biblical stories because the non-violent scenes in The Passion were immaculate, but we cannot control the direction an artist takes--nor should we want to. Here, in Apocalypto, we have an amazing story of human misery, love, loyalty, and valor. This movie is not for children as it would horrify and depress the living heck out of them, but it definitely is for adults; particularly those adults who wish to categorize and analyze our collective human experience. Our ancestors' lives brimmed with tragedy-plagued days such as these and many of these scenes are unforgettable.<br /><br />Most importantly, Apocalypto illustrates how foolish we are to be as obsessed over comparatively insignificant matters such as race, ethnicity, and culture. The hero here, Jaguar Paw, is a member of a different race, time, and culture than my own, yet this reviewer--and practically every other person who sees this film--cheered for his survival with dramatic intensity. This is due to our ability to relate to him at a level far deeper than that of race, sex, and class. All of us intrinsically feel a need to defeat forces of unscrupulous evil, and that is bigger than the superficial conditions placed upon us by our birth. What these small Mayan clans faced at that time was an apocalypse, and Jaguar Paw is a man we should all admire. I could not turn this one off and disagree with the other reviewers who criticized its ending. The final frames were fulfilling.
First time I've ever left a review, and could simply say DITTO to many of the previous comments left here, but just had to put in my own two cents - because this film is so amazing!  Just got around to viewing it last night and how I wish I'd seen it on the Big Screen!  But that aside, Mel is a man I've admired and kept in sight since Mad Max and with many of his subsequent directorial projects has proven to put Hollywood to shame.  We need filmmakers like him to remind us of the power of images/stories and the emotions and new thought they can inspire in us, that we need not just be moderately entertained or suckered into theatres by previews that end up being a collage of the few best moments.  THIS FILM is a work of art and a labor of love, shared by so many from Mel to cinematographers to costumers to weapons designers to actors to editors!  It IS mesmerizing from beginning to end.  You quickly come to truly care about Jaguar Paw and his people, and share their horror and disbelief at the level of debasement brought by those who attack and overwhelm them.  Survival of the 'fittest'?  Yet, who among us can altogether avoid the violence of this world?  I saw an analogy for today - there's a big difference between aggressive power (which consumes the souls of the aggressors as well) and defense of one's family and way of life.  Mel has explored this theme before but it bears repeating - WHAT are you willing to fight (and possibly die) FOR?  If 'Hollywood' had made this film, it would have ended with Jaguar Paw (and his pregnant wife and small son) the losers - obliterated and unmourned - the 'obligatory' ending; but instead we are left - not with the Happy Ever After ending - but the realism that they must go on and face yet another possible wave of destroyers.  Don't get me wrong, I don't buy into the 'Noble Savage' myth; progress has its good among its bad.  This film will have you thinking long afterwards about WHAT and WHO SHOULD survive to live another day.<br /><br />Enrich your mind and your spirit (and choose which side you will take), and see this film!
I'll start off by saying that you'll find nothing about the historic accuracy in my review. I'm just reviewing this for anyone looking to see a good film. Mel Gibson is no doubt good at what he does and Apocolypto is very well done also. There will be mixed feelings towards this movie I'm sure as there were towards 'The Passion of the Christ" but this is a good movie. Apocalypto shows a young mans amazing and heart pounding experience during the decline of the Mayan Civilization. The movie starts with young Jaguar Paw and his father Flint Sky hunting in the jungle with some other men from their tribe. While teasing a fellow tribe-member for the group is startled by something. As the viewer you can barely see what has caught the men off guard because it is hiding so well in the jungle. It turns out to be a large number of people from another village.<br /><br />They do not say much just that they want to cross the village and want no trouble. A man crossing looks deep into Jaguar Paw's eyes and the man passes him a feeling without even saying anything, the feeling was fear. Back at the village Jaguar Paw knew that something was coming and he was right. Early in the morning while the fires still smoking and the people asleep men appear from nowhere. The men attack the village trying not to kill but injuring many. Overtaking this village will not be easy for them as everyone is fighting to protect their families. Who has not been killed is being tied up and taken except for children. After traveling a far distance from their village Jaguar Paw and his people are then taken to a city with a huge temple and from here is where the movie really and I mean really gets exciting. Jaguar Paw must find a way to get back to his village and save his wife and child who he hid in a dry well before it fills up from rain. I don't want to give away anything but lets say that Jaguar Paw makes one of the most courageous and exciting stands ever.<br /><br />I saw Apocalypto and as I was watching all the things most movie previews promise came true in this film. All the "Heart Pounding", "Jaw Dropping", "Nonstop Action", and "You'll be on the Edge of Your Seat" promises came true. This movie has such a realistic feel to it as well as these actors. You can feel it all from the fear to the determination and courage of Jaguar Paw. There is no way that you could watch this film and not feel anything. This films action and suspense truly never stops and I mean that literally. The acting is so good that you forget that they're actors and believe that they're really the characters they're portraying.<br /><br />Mel Gibson did an amazing job in making these settings and people look so real. Jaguar Paws story is out of this world, had it been done in some modern day culture, a man trying to retrieve his family would not be this good. Because the elements of Jaguar Paw being very outnumbered it makes a high demand of physical and mental endurance to survive in a jungle and this movie becomes more interesting. He truly has no weapons except the jungle he grew up in and knows like the back of his hand but still exhaustion and time are not on his side. His journey becomes all the more impossible and this makes the movie that more intriguing cause you want him to succeed. This film is definitely not for the squeamish type, there's nothing in it you wouldn't find in most scary flicks today but it is still very violent. Apocalypto is an amazing movie that I would recommend to many but be ready to sit on the edge of your seat cause you'll be there for most of the film.
Once again, Mel Gibson has shown that authenticity in film making is not impossible or too costly! Granted, some have said that the film takes away<br /><br />from the Mayans. In truth, however for students of History, The Mayan ancestors were  even more gory with their sports as they were with their sacrifices to their gods.
I really didn't know what to expect going into this film, I heard all the hype and stories. Gibson certainly did not fail with this film, bringing a visually stunning vision to film. The scenes of the Mayan capital made my head swim as I tried to envision the sheer size of the set. Here are also the most graphic portions, however that said, I would say I have seen much worse in cinema lately, this was nothing compared elsewhere.<br /><br />I will say I was somewhat let down when the film turned to the action genre in the last 1/3 of it, a sort of mayan version of "First Blood" as the lone hero manages to outwit and outsmart the evil men perusing at every turn. It sort of seemed anti-climatic to me as the 'mayan epic' turned into another Hollywood rehash.<br /><br />Gibson got allot of flack for doing this film in the original language, personally this was fine for me and I thought it added to the atmosphere of the film and provided an immersion into the film that english would not have.<br /><br />All in all, a decent film, beautifully filmed with interesting characters and a view of a society that we rarely (if ever) get to see a glimpse of.
I keep seeing these complaints that Gibson "failed to shed light on why the culture disappeared".  How in Heaven's name, could he???<br /><br />  The Mayan culture had degenerated from a single united kingdom by 1441 (a half-century before Columbus, and 500 years after the "classic" period of Mayan culture had ended).  The Aztec and Inca were the only remaining Mesoamerican empires by the time the Spaniards arrived in 1517, with the Old World diseases (not religion) which so weakened the already-crumbling empires that they could not resist the heavily outnumbered Spaniards.<br /><br />  Many scientists and sociologists consider the Spanish as the symptom, rather than the disease, so to speak, since the Aztec and Inca dissolved in much the same manner as the earlier Olmec, Maya, and Toltec, which had declined well before the Spaniards.  In short, if the experts can't explain it, how in God's name would you expect a Hollywood "director" to come up with the answers???
We all know what Mel Gibson Done with his Great Movie From The Man Without Face To BreaveHeart To The Passion Of The Christ .<br />All Mel's Movie That He direct Talk About Humanity And Love in a deferent way , This time in Mayan-language Apocalypto you going to see a deferent kind of movie That we missed<br /><br />What is Apocalypto about?<br />From the Apocalypto website:<br /><br />"A heart stopping mythic action-adventure set against the turbulent end times of the once great Mayan civilization. When his idyllic existence is brutally disrupted be a violent invading force, a man is taken on a perilous journey to a world ruled by fear and oppression where a harrowing end awaits him. Through a twist of fate and spurred by the power of his love for his woman and his family he will make a desparate break to return home and to ultimately save his way of life."<br />-------------------------------<br />The actors! we've ever heard of<br />The director is Mel Gibson<br />Composer James Horner (who did Troy,A Beautiful Mind, Titanic and many more)<br />Rated R for sequences of graphic violence and disturbing images<br />Everywhere In the US on 8th of December 2006<br /><br />(and now its nominated for Golden Globe)
The fact that the Mayan civilization died out well before the Spanish landed on the mainland of the Americas did not hinder the co-writers of this bloody jungle epic. The role given the Mayans in the film is simply the chore of obtaining captives to be supplied the priests for multiple blood sacrifices. This gruesome custom is well documented in the Aztec civilization, which was intact when the Spanish arrived, but the film maintains both that the Mayans participated in similar bloodletting and that their culture survived intact into the modern era. It perhaps is true that archeologists studying the Yucatan Mayan remains now believe that in fact multiple sacrificial bloodletting among Mayans actually occurred, but it is a certainty the Mayan culture did not survive long enough to see Spanish sailing ships as we do in this film.<br /><br />The heroes in the Gibson film are relatively peaceable jungle denizens whose villages are ruthlessly pillaged by a more warlike tribe who sell their captives to the Mayans, who in turn use them as slaves or for blood sacrifices. We do not see much of the fruits of Mayan culture, nor learn of their calendar, their astronomy, or other intellectual attainments. It's ersatz history shown from the bottom up, so to speak, and it's very well done in the sense that the violent action, the cast, the sets, the costumes, the makeup, etc., seem terribly authentic. It gets one thinking that the Spanish with their Jesuits can arrive none too soon to put a stop to the grotesque mayhem going on. To say the film depicts violence would be an understatement.<br /><br />The latter half of the film allows Jaguar Paw, our hero, to escape the Mayan enclave by surviving a gauntlet of bolos, clubs, spears and arrows. He then is pursued by very credible warriors. The chase, which is a terrific, almost wordless, adventure, goes on literally for days. It ends, implausibly, with the hero finally safe and reunited with his wife, who has given birth to a baby--underwater, no less. In the early part of the film, a diseased girl, treated as an outcast, predicts to the Mayans their end is coming, among other things via a jaguar and a dark day. The director makes sure that the audience cannot miss seeing the girl's predictions being fulfilled one by one.<br /><br />All in all, it's got to be the bloodiest adventure yarn ever filmed with what seems to me to be an ersatz historical affectation.
For my purposes, I shall allow all of the other reviewers to give you a synopsis of the action that unfolds in the story.<br /><br />Looking deeper into the context of the film, however, reveals Gibson's vision of a society in decay.  The Mayan civilization of the Yucatan, more advanced in its time than many European societies, is portrayed as on the edge of self-destruction.  Destroying their surrounding forests to make way for crop land and construction, exhausting what little arable soil they do possess, raiding and plundering, wallowing in urban decadence, the Maya not only sacrifice human captives to the gods, but also unwittingly sacrifice their entire civilization.  It seems, though, that Gibson is offering a critical commentary not only on the pre-Columbian Maya, but also on contemporary America.  We are also making some of the same mistakes.  Look at our desecration of the environment and also of human life.  Are we also sacrificing our young men to appease the "gods"?  Are we also sacrificing ourselves upon an altar that the entire world gazes at?  Gibson seems to be hinting at something much more subtle than just one civilization's disintegration.  The film may seem to be a major assault upon Western sensibilities and notions regarding violence, religion, human life, and cultural values.  But look closer.  Strip away the veneer of the "civilizing" modern. Are we really any different from these Mayan "savages"?  Perhaps we also share and delight in their primal lusts.<br /><br />The movie is very good and will keep your attention throughout; however, I think that Gibson really could have went somewhere altogether different in this project.  The middle of the movie, which focuses upon the Mayan city and the slow, horrifying progression towards the temple altar, where men are to be slain, is the most essential aspect in bestowing ideological significane to the film as a whole.  It is cinematography at its very best - dark, mysterious, apocalyptic.  The painted and tattoed bodies of the Maya, as they stare up in rapture for human blood to heal their land, are harshly beautiful.  A head with long black hair falls precipitously down the temple steps; the body follows.  A roar of excitement resounds across the city walls - an emotional release that has been building and fomenting among these people.  It is here, among the pyramids, decay, and spilled blood, that the viewer gets a glimpse into how great this film could have been.  It is perhaps one of the most visually ravishing films thus far in the 21st century, and it is because of this, that I wish Gibson would have transformed his entire film with similar cinematography.  The rest of the movie is much more conventional, but it is here that Gibson could have created a Fellini-esque cinematic experience, one equivalent and analagous to the Satyricon.  But he came up short.<br /><br />The film ends on what I believe to be an injustice and grievous insult to the preceding action.  It becomes far too exagerrated, melodramatic, and the ending makes use of a terrible deus ex machina, which should be considered an affront upon the audience's intelligence.  What greatness Gibson gives unto his film throughout is almost undone by the final ten to fifteen minutes of action.  The film is not historically accurate in several aspects, but these are very minor.  It should be noted, however, that the Maya had already collapsed centuries before the arrival of the Spanish.  In the end, we are left with the stage for a new beginning, and the viewer is reminded that out of decadence comes rebirth and resurrection.
I saw this on opening day, it was great. There is alotta talk about boycott,I just watched some Jewish guy who votes for the academy say "there is no way this movie will get my vote and I refuse to see it".Wow should'nt we be judging the movie and not the man. Its ironic that Gibson was condemned for his statements on Jews, while Nash was given the Nobel Prize for his economic theories and have ravings daily slamminng Jews and going completely completely ignored. Now I preface the rest of this by explaining something I normally Don't, I'm not a racist. This allows me to make openly offensive statements. So when I say things like Jews might wanna quit saying " I'm not spending my money on anything with Mel Gibson". Incase you are unaware, Jews have a reputation for are you ready for this are ya, are ya BEING CHEAP. If you are or know someone who is refusing to see this movie because that a drunk said some things that hurt your feelings, well you are the prejudice one if you can't understand and accept that people have other views than you and that people don't like your views then you are the racist. Go see this movie it will do you some good. As I close remember the next time somebody says something that you disagree with and the leeches like Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton come with their demands there is an easy fix. Rather than argue and fight accept their views. If the guys Michael Richards "offended" rather than fueled the fire would have said Okay you think I'm a nigger, well I disagree with you. You don't let it affect your poise its that simple
I sat down to watch this movie with absolutely NO expectations.  The movie draggs on a bit... it's hard to know if this movie has any historical accuracy.  Gibson portrays Myans as brutal savages.  I found myself intruiged by his portrayal of their culture from the perspective of tatoos, dress, etc.  Visually, it was stunning.<br /><br />There is over the top graphic violence... in many cases unnecessary...followed by what becomes a very long and ultimately predictable ending.
Mel Gibson may be an antisemitic mofo, but he can still make a great movie. This is evident with Apocalypto. "Gripping" is how I would best describe its action and plot. Some people may shy away from it because of the subtitles, but there is little dialog so you don't miss that much. The acting is good so the words just play to that really. If you liked 300, then I think you'll like this. Or Braveheart.
I saw this movie in Lisbon, Portugal and I'm speechless with this master piece witch shows perfectly the decline of one civizilitation.  The story, the realization, the strength of all the characters, the rhythm, the power of this film makes it one of the best movies of the year. I recommend it to every one. Congratulations to Mr. Mel Gibson.
Gotta go with the ole 3/5 on this one. I kept waiting for the movie to get good, maybe for some arse kicking to exact the much-needed revenge of the travesties from the beginning and it mostly never came. The movie, overall, consisted of endless savagery. Some parts were barely digestible and I considered stopping the movie simply because of its unpleasantness (not in a "wow, that's really gory", but "Yeah, humans can be pretty awful, I don't think I need another example of it ostensibly wrapped up as entertainment").<br /><br />Certainly there were in fact no memorable moments at all and I would be surprised if even somebody who somehow gave this 5/5 would find any reason to watch it a second time.
Don't say I didn't try. Mel, you deserve every chance in the world. I loved your wonderful film on Scotland. I know you can do it. That said, this film, although colorful and well-done as far as make-up and sets are concerned, is a huge disappointment. It is really the "Bourne Ultimatum" with bad acting. There is one chase after the other, lots of blood and guts, and then the happy ending. It's the worst kind of trivial Hollywood entertainment, pure Saturday afternoon cartoon dreck, but it stands out from the crowd because of the expectation created by Gibson's previous work that it might be historically interesting and perhaps even inspiring. Unfortunately, it fails at all levels, save for the extraordinary costume designs and sets which may or may not be historically accurate. Let the anthropologists work that out. For myself, it was pure nonsense from first to last and a complete waste of a real talent with the means to do virtually anything. When the Spanish arrive, we are to assume that Gibson wants to suggest that America del Sur had finally been liberated by its burden of heathen prejudice and had finally gotten the chance to discover Our Lord the Saviour. If this is true, we can say that the film does have a socially redeeming value and cannot, as a result, be defined according to the Supreme Court as pornography.
Boy it has been quite a couple days, let me tell you.  First my village was burned, and I was marched off to be sacrificed, but just as I was about to have my heart torn from my body, there was a total eclipse. Then that night there was a full moon.  God sure does work in mysterious ways!  Anyway, the next day, my son was born right before I saved my wife from drowning, and just as the first Europeans showed up on the beach next to my old village. Can you believe it?!?  Stay tuned, dear Diary.  Who knows what will happen tomorrow!
Before I get into the review, I want to say that I was hoping Mel Gibson would turn out to be a latter-day Ezra Pound: creative genius who got kneecapped over some foolish behavior, and then rescued from the cage where he was being held on display by some transcendent piece of work!  It still might happen for Mr. Gibson, but it won't be with "Apocalypto".<br /><br />The movie was hobbled right from the beginning with the language.  Imagine what would have happened if Shakespeare had written "Julius Caesar" in Latin?  Or "Romeo and Juliet" in Italian?  Or "Hamlet" in Danish?  You wouldn't have had to do a term paper on any of these plays, because they wouldn't have survived to the present day--much less been required reading to graduate High School.<br /><br />  I know the authentic language gimmick worked well for Mel Gibson with an earlier film, but most of the people who saw that one already knew the story, and all the dialogue had already been translated into hundreds of different languages hundreds of years before they started on that script.  The screenwriters for "Apocalypto" didn't get a good enough handle on the language to write any nuance or personality into the different characters.  The actors, too, didn't seem capable of much more than delivering their sentences like ninth graders in a Spanish class.<br /><br />OK, so maybe primitive man didn't have a lot of time to develop an air of savoir fare, but medieval Scottish clan leaders didn't spend five minutes openly lamenting the possible domino effect of all human action before gutting a rival who was sleeping.  Sometimes you have to cheat out to tell a good story.<br /><br />And then sometimes...you need to show a little restraint.<br /><br />Oh yeah...There was WAAAAY too much splatter.  The Mayans did have human sacrifice.  They also had those "DOUBLE" sacrifices, where both the heart and head were removed from the sacrifice&eacute;.  However, I sincerely doubt that the sum total of all the Mayan human sacrifices was even half of what was shown in "Apocalypto".  Also, Mayan human sacrifices were either children, because of their purity, or great warriors: they wouldn't have tried to placate their gods with a bunch of captured hillbillies--that's just asking for another year of drought and plagues.<br /><br />(OK, so it kinda looked like the one priest was making it appear that these guys were brave warriors; and if Mr. Gibson wanted to show the hypocrisy of this society in that way, maybe he should have spent a little more time on this and less time bowling heads down the pyramid like it was a league tournament between the Kiwanises and the Jaycees.)<br /><br />Especially gratuituous was the camera shot of the victim watching his own head roll down the pyramid after it was cut off.  Why hogtie your script and actors with an esoteric language for the sake of authenticity, and then add a physical element that only exists in "Friday the 13th" movies?<br /><br />Lastly..."Apocalypto" shamelessly plagiarizes "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court", and "The Naked Prey", to snag a couple cheap plot devices. ("Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", too.)  This whole movie was clearly a catastrophe of working too hard on the wrong things.  It's too bad.  Pre-Columbian culture, with or without a stadium-load of lopped heads, provides a wealth of interesting stories, and the inherent danger and beauty of this world would have made it a slam dunk for a date movie.<br /><br />Understand, "Apocalypto", is not a bad movie: just a disappointing one.  I thought it aimed for the lowest common denominator; and rather than making a hypothetical study of the mind of an individual who lived in this culture that was physically right next door, but socially a bajillion miles away from our own, it became an action flick where the object was to show human insides on the outside in the juiciest ways possible.<br /><br />If Mel Gibson wishes to continue to make films about outr&eacute; historic subjects, he might want to take a crack at the Captain Alfred Dreyfus scandal.  It takes place in 19th Century France, so he could show a guillotining whenever he felt the story needed a little boost, and taking on this theme would generate enough controversy to provide free advertising.  Plus if he sprouted a beard and played the role of Zola, it could be the most talked about movie of the year.
I had a very personal reason for wanting to see the film -- we are adopting a child from Guatemala soon. So, I was hoping that the film, with it's use of a Mayan language, a native cast and shot on location in the Yucatan Peninsula, would give me a flavor for the locale. I will say, on that level, the movie succeeds. The cinematography is gorgeous, the performances are good, and you do get somewhat of a sense of what it might be like to live in the ancient Mayan culture.<br /><br />But forget about the controversies around the historical inaccuracies or Gibson himself. When all is said and done, this is just a one dimensional, violent Hollywood action film set in an atypically exotic locale. The setting and language are used in an attempt to make the film seem more substantial than it actually is. The plot is very basic, and there is a fair amount of excitement along the way. As with most action films, there is some silliness, too. (For instance, two characters are endangered by rainfall, but it would have to be raining at about 5 feet an hour - a bit much, even for a rain forest). And, yes indeed, there is really some over the top violence on view. Co-screenwriter Mel spent lots of time coming up with new ways to depict people killing each other. These very graphic scenes are not for the squeamish, to be sure.<br /><br />If Mel has an agenda here, as some claim, it's presented in such a shallow way that's it's impossible to take seriously. It's really too bad, because this really could have been a terrific movie -- there's was so much to work with in this cultural milieu. Unfortunately, that's secondary to the fairly standard action elements. If you can put up with the gore, than what you've got here is an enjoyable live action cartoon thrill ride, but not much more.
One teensy scene upgrade: GODZILLA shows up onshore! It would have made for a much more believable film. Why not come out of the closet my dearest Mel and just make a horror flick, all the elements did present well. Why bother with the diversionary costly landscape, which was breathtaking and single redeeming feature. The same plot, flute theme, final showdown, blood, gore, hatred inducing scenes, over and over again. YAWN!!! JagPaw, JagWar, JigSaw, SeeSaw, BigKflaw....
If you like to learn anything about our history as a paople then you will love this movie.
After watching excellent Gibson movies like like Braveheart, Passion of the Christ and Signs, I watched with disappointment Apocalypto. The movie has good picture and excellent special effects as well as action but all these good traits are constantly overshadow by an exaggerated display of gore. Now, I'm OK with gore when used to emphasize the plot but large parts of this movie seem to be the other way around: There's some plot added to emphasize the gore. I would not recommend you to buy this movie. Rent it instead.

if you want to see a movie that shows 100 different ways to die in the jungle than check this movie out.
This movie was very well adapted telling of the fall of the Mayans. I recomment this movie to anyone of latin decent and african americans. It shows how entire civilizations can be destroyed from within themselves rather than from outsiders!
I can't remember the last time a movie blew me completely out of my shoes as thoroughly as did Apocalypto. Whatever you think of Mel Gibson's messed-up personal life, the guy is a creative genius.<br /><br />Apocalypto is set in the pre-Columbian Mayan peninsula, and opens in a small Indian village whose young men are out in the jungle hunting a wild boar, led by their chief Flint Sky and his son Jaguar Paw. They encounter something else they never expected -- a party of terrified refugees whose village has been raided and destroyed. Little do they know that the fate of those refugees is about to hit their own tribe.<br /><br />In a pre-dawn raid the very next day, their own village is attacked by a war party of Indians from another tribe. Most of the adults, including Flint Sky, are killed, the children are spared, and Jaguar Paw, after managing to hide his pregnant wife and little son down a dry well, is captured along with some twenty other people in his tribe and dragged off to the Mayan capital. There they come upon a culture they never knew existed, vastly superior to their own, and built on a caste system that depends heavily on slave labor. But they realize they haven't been captured to be slaves -- they are human sacrifices to the Mayan god Kukulkan. Spared by a solar eclipse, Jaguar Paw and a few survivors of the carnage in Kukulkan's temple are turned over to the war party who make a game of them dodging spears and arrows before they are all killed. Only Jaguar Paw manages to flip the script, and in a stunning act of defiance of fate, kills the son of the war party's chief and escapes into the forest, with nine warriors after him screaming for his head.<br /><br />From there the film takes on an eerie resemblance to "The Naked Prey" with overtones of Xenophon's "Anabasis", with Jaguar Paw running home ahead of the pursuing party through hostile territory, trying to stay alive long enough to get back home in time to rescue his wife and son. And in a thrilling plot twist, once he manages to get back to familiar territory, the tables are turned when Jaguar Paw has the home-field advantage and the hunters turn into the hunted.<br /><br />The acting and directing in this film could not be improved upon. Rudy Youngblood gives a knockout performance as Jaguar Paw, caught up in a hell he never imagined and intent only on getting back to his world and his family. Raoul Trujillo and Gerardo Taracena are chilling as the pursuing warriors Zero Wolf and Middle Eye, and Morris Yellowbirdhead is excellent as Flint Sky. Gibson even got great performances from the children, especially Carlos Emilio Baez as Jaguar Paw's little son, and Maria Isidra Hoil and Aquetzali Garcia, who share the role of the Oracle Girl; their eerie voices ("You fear me? So you should, all you who are vile... would you like to know how you are going to die?") send shivers down your spine. The Indian village and the Mayan city are so convincingly portrayed that we can feel just what it would be like living in either place. And the haunting sound track helps to make us feel we're deep in the middle of 15th century meso-America.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, Apocalypto is a knockout film experience. Don't see it for its historical accuracy (inaccuracies abound in this movie); see it for what it is, a glorious action-adventure film that will keep you mesmerized from beginning to end.<br /><br />Judy Lind
I bought this movie in blu-ray format - and the clarity (quality) did not dissappoint. Excessive violence - and I still battle with having to "read" the entire movie. Subtitles distract from watching what is happening. Just my opinion!
Have and will order from again!  Fast shipping, items exactly as described.<br /><br />Thank you
This is my first review ever of a film on Amazon.com so I'm hoping that you will find my comments concerning Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" to be refreshingly different.  And considering the fact that I own over 6,000 movies doesn't at all make me an expert but hopefully you will find my views about this film and my take on Mel Gibson as a Director to honest ones.<br /><br />And I guess I'd like to open this commentary by suggesting that it is really difficult for anyone to come up with a new and refreshing idea in Hollywood and having said that, I did not find the film "Apocalypto" to be one which blazed any new trails although the setting was certainly unique and refreshingly different.  So when I began watching this film, I was initially hopeful that I would see something which would keep me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end but ended up finding myself to be a little bit disappointed.  And I'm only saying this because once the chase scene (and Mel Gibson open has admitted that he wanted to "create an incomparable chase film in which a man must put everything on the line") began involving Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and the Holcane warriors, led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), I not only felt that I was not seeing an "incomparable" chase scene presented on film and knew at least 40 minutes before the end of the film that the hero would reach the ocean, accidentally bump into the first European explorers and would achieve that ultimate salvation, survival for both himself and his wife and children.<br /><br />And so, after watching this film, I listened to Mel Gibson's audio commentary hoping that like other directors, he would at some point pay homage to Cornel Wilde's "The Naked Prey" but he did not do so.  And so I felt not only disappointed but also thought Mel Gibson was more than a little bit disingenuous with his audience because far greater directors than himself have willingly and openly acknowledged and have payed homage to others and other ideas which have influenced their works of art.  And I could give you many examples which would show how truly "comparable" the two films are but let's just say that Wilde's the "Man" and the leader of the African warriors (Ken Gampu) are exactly the same characters.  Only the location and historical setting is different.  And I will go so far as to suggest, since I own the original movie poster for "The Naked Prey" that even the poster art is similar, although I will admit that the budgets for the two films were in no way similar.<br /><br />So basically, I am suggesting that if you really want to see a truly original and "incomparable chase" film in which a man is forced to put everything on the line, I would recommend that you see "The Naked Prey!"  And this is the only reason that I give Mel Gibson's film only 3 stars; mainly I saw nothing original about his film and of course, because I knew the outcome of his film way before it ever ended, I was left feeling more than a little bit disappointed and felt that I had seen this story before.  Still, I enjoy many of Mel Gibson's films and have enjoyed his newer works as a director, including this film.  However, I still feel that really humble and far greater directors than Gibson acknowledge the roots of their art and feel that he has failed to do so with this film.
This movie definitely stands out among the other films released right now as something unique to see at least once. And it is pretty good overall- the cast is as strong as they could be and the scenes are a thing of beauty for the most part- but if I would ever watch it again...I don't think I would.<br /><br />Although the movie has its strong points that make it a success... it's just not an exciting film from beginning to end. Actually towards the end I grew bored. I don't know if it was the length of the film or my overall lack of being able to really, fully get into the entire story- but eventually the movie got to that point where I had to wonder when it's finally going to end.<br /><br />So really it's good to watch once to me, but not good enough to watch again.<br /><br />3.5/5
This was among the greatest films released in this decade. I loved its setting amid lush and savage jungles. Its vivid and violent depictions of life among the great Maya were as nothing done in Hollywood in a generation. The exciting story this motion picture told kept its rapt audience on the edge of its seat through a lengthy running time. Right up to the very end I was in love with Mel Gibson's latest cinematic accomplishment: and then in the last five minutes I was confronted with an anachronism so overpowering it shattered the suspension of disbelief that had me feeling I was witnessing the actual Mayan civilization somehow delivered onscreen. I will not be so rude as to cite the flawed intrusion here, nor was it enough to make me hesitate to give this film a well-deserved five-stars, but I would like to ask Mel Gibson what on earth he was thinking to have introduced something so historically inaccurate as...as what he did. That left me genuinely saddened and very definitely puzzled. I recommend Apocalypto to anyone with an interest in ancient America, but I would like to hit Mel Gibson upside the head with a history book.
If you like road warrior, youre going to enjoy this one.<br /><br />All the cars are gone.  people have been reduced to primitive hunting gathering.  bad guys attack mad max's village and the action doesnt stop.<br /><br />i hope mel directs the next pirates movie or the hobbit. he does better work than that peter jackson dude. (its a 5 star mad max movie but I had to take it down for the offensive racist historical nonsense  mel needs to revisit "Brev&iacute;sima relaci&oacute;n de la destrucci&oacute;n de las Indias")
While this is a powerful portrayal of the Mayan culture, it lacks both breadth and depth (not what I have come to expect from Mel Gibson).  The Mayan people were so much more than what is depicted here.  Without a context in which to fully understand this film, one would assume the Mayans were little more than savages, when in fact they had a well developed civilization.  Not recommended!
Visually - this movie is very appealling. It is incredibly violent. Mel just loves to make movies with sets involving young child actors strewn around burning villages being prompted to cry over their sodomized and decapitated family members. I wonder where the envelope ends for him as a director. I guess its OK if you can show pre-Cortez Mayan Indians praying to St Mary or quoting passages from the Lord's Prayer.<br /><br />But hey... No animals were injured in the making of this film.
We just got done seeing this movie at the theater...<br /><br />I really wanted to love Apocalypto, because I think the media gives Mr. Gibson much more than his fair share of bad press.<br /><br />Why is it that only Gibson seems to be criticized for violence on the big screen?<br /><br />If the subject matter of the film deals with violence, then it should be included in the film. No one slammed Spielberg for making Saving Private Ryan overly violent.<br /><br />And just about every review I've read about Apocalypto trashes Gibson the man, instead of reviewing the film on its own merits.<br /><br />I don't recall Roman Polanski (a convicted child molester) being dragged through the mud when The Pianist was released.<br /><br />But enough about all that...<br /><br />Unfortunately, Apocalypto did not live up to my high hopes.<br /><br />Apocalypto is basically an extremely formulaic chase film. The story also moves along with very familiar plot clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />The good guys are very good, the bad guys are very bad. The good guy escapes, gets revenge, and saves his family. It's not a great film, but it's well done for what it is.<br /><br />Personally, I'm very interested in Mayan culture, having visited several sites in Mexico and Belize.<br /><br />In terms of the way the Mayans were represented in the film, I thought it was a bit over the top.<br /><br />While the Mayans were a very war-like culture, and they did perform human sacrifice, there's no evidence that they would sacrifice hundreds of people at a time.<br /><br />Since this is the first major motion picture about the Mayans, I fear that uninformed folks will walk away thinking of the Mayans as one huge death cult. With all of the achievements of the Mayans, they deserve better.<br /><br />In terms of violence, I'm not squeamish, but there were several moments where I thought, "Well, that wasn't necessary, was it?"<br /><br />If a jaguar bites a man's face, do I really need a close up of the dude's jaw bones getting crushed in the cat's mouth? I don't think so.<br /><br />All that said... I have to congratulate Mel for focusing the Mayans, creating a movie using all unknown actors, and using the Mayan language.<br /><br />That in itself is a huge achievement. It's a part of history that has been ignored for too long. Especially by Hollywood!<br /><br />Keep up the good work, Mel.
This is the story of a 16th century young Mayan Indian man named Jaguar's Paw, who gets captured along with other members of his tribe by a ruthless band of Mayan warriors. He finds out as time goes on that he has been captured so that he can be used as a human sacrifice to the gods so that they will send rain.<br /><br />But Jaguar's Paw is determined to survive. He has hidden his pregnant wife and young son in an empty well, and he wants to go back to them. Will he make it? Will he live to tell about it?<br /><br />One other thing: Beware of the violence. You will see people getting beheaded, hearts getting ripped out of chests, people's throats being slit, and a jaguar ripping the face off of a man. There's more, but you get the idea, this is a bloody, gory movie. It is a 16th century Rambo, or possibly a 16th century Lord of the Flies, take your pick, maybe a little of both.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie for kids. I also wish that the film could have given more of a historical context for what was happening on screen.<br /><br />Yet the storyline was easy enough to follow (the movie is in Mayan with English dubbing). It is recommedend for adults only.
Well worth seeing due to the scenes in the Mayan city.<br /><br />This is where the movie fell short. Too much time spent running through<br />the jungle which should have been spent showing the spectacular<br />civilization/culture in the Mayan city.<br /><br />Also kind of hard to indentify with the characters in the movie. As you<br />would with Cosner in "Dances with Wolves" or Mel Gibson in "Braveheart."<br /><br />The ending is kind of quirky. A 15 second shot of very huge changes to come.<br />Inserting this 15 second glimpse into the ending made the movie seem<br />even more lacking than it was.<br /><br />Dissapointing to see a movie with so much potential come up so short.
I enjoyed the historical aspect of this film but felt it portrayed only the gruesome side of the civilization.
I have read, with some amusement, the comments made about this movie here on Amazon. It is really too bad this movie was made by Mel Gibson given his untimely drunk driving arrest and offensive statements about the Jewish culture. What that has to do with an ancient Mayan civilization I have no idea, but I digress.<br /><br />Taking away the possibility of commentary on current affairs, this is a very entertaining (albeit somewhat gory) film. There is a great story about family and perserverance that is consistent throughout the film and it has some very authentic, compelling moments and scenes.<br /><br />To those who think it is too gory--the film is authentic. We are talking about tribes who warred before guns were invented. The weapons were typically blunt objects, knives and arrows or spears. Grow up--they are not as surgical as bullets. The Mayans were clearly a people misguided by their leaders and on their last legs (sound familiar, Bill O'Reilly?). In the end, the story is about one warrior and his personal struggle for family. I kind of found it more like Die Hard meets the jungle.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. Kudos to all involved.
This movie was better than I expected, but worse than it could have been.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO is action, blood and gore Mel Gibson-style: predictable and derivative of some of his other films, particularly BRAVEHEART. Yes, you get to relive the organs-being-pulled-from-the-body experience, also on a stage in front of a cheering mob. As one of my friends pointed out, Gibson has a thing about body paints, another loaner from BRAVEHEART. Too, Jaguar Paw periodically channels Gibson's PATRIOT character, albeit with a blowgun instead of a tomahawk, but you get the picture.<br /><br />I did like the fact that, as formulaic as the film was, there was at least an attempt to portray pre-Columbian mesoamericans. Yeah, they wore thongs and had weird Moe Howard haircuts, just like in INDIANA JONES (another contributor to the movie's elements), but they also had personalities, and the cinematography was good. And even though Gibson oversimplified the culture and religion, and compressed centuries of development into a timeframe of less than a week, he at least tried to get some of the details right, such as the language.<br /><br />Gibson has always been heavy-handed with symbolism and theme, spelling it out instead of letting these revelations come more subtly. And the arrival of European ships...what was THAT all about? That scene had nothing to do with the story.<br /><br />Critics have been all over this film for its inaccuracies, and those are valid complaints. But: compared to what? What other Mayan-civilization movies are better?<br /><br />It was undoubtedly contrived. But it sort of had to be. This is politically-incorrect to say, but watching a movie about the daily life of a primitive tribe isn't all that compelling. Think about it: hunt, cook meat, eat, hang around the hut, do over again the next day. What else is there?<br /><br />Well, okay: the body paint. But you can get a nice set of those at Miss Fantasia's Boutique.
Despite the photography, the exotic civilization, and the engaging actors, you never fully engage with this work. The set up doesn't hold to the conventional ending.
Nice natives vs. mean natives.  This movie is actually 4 disctinct shorts:  Peacefule village life, invasion and forced march, specatcular city with cg effects and then madmax in the jungle.  Scene one finds Gibson once again obssessing over male genetalia, sex jokes that would evoke yawns from a third grader and animal brutality.  So much could have (and should have) been done here.  Scene two lifted staight from The Last of the Mohicans with some fresh gore.  Scene three: well while historically inaccurate it's great to see an Aztec (yes Aztec) city re-created in all it's brutal glory. Any truth to Gibson's portrayal?  Open to debate. Spectacular though.  I used to feel sorry for the Aztecs, but no more.  Scene four is too much of an insult to comment on.  Obviously Gibson surrounded himself with spineless yes men.  Didn't anyone have the guts to say "No" to this man? How ironic though that Gibson concludes the film with a sense of the Catholic brutality that is soon to be visited on the local population. Would have been a great movie under the direction of someone else.
I think the fact that people aren't streaming to the theatres to see Apocalypto is proof enough that Passion of the Christ wasn't actually the "modern masterpiece" Christian groups made it out to be. People loved that movie out of religious fervor, not actual cinematic quality. Apocalypto falls somewhere between the brilliance of Braveheart and the Patheticness of Passion. It's just an alright movie.<br /><br />The sheer novelty of a movie about the Mayan civilization, in Mayan, with subtitles, is a draw for some people. And the trailer is beautiful. The movie itself has many beautiful moments, but it never really rises above being a chase movie / supernatural thriller. If it weren't for the awesome locations, costumes, and acting, this movie would be a typical thriller. But it DOES have all those things, so it's actually pretty enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />At times the violence and gore is difficult to deal with, but it can be argued that it's pretty historically accurate. It also makes the entire situation more heightened when you see what's truly at stake and the real ferocious nature of the Mayans.<br /><br />Aside from the violence, I didn't really find anything about the movie to be controversial. Honestly, it's not that deep of a movie. Without revealing too much, here's the general plot: a small village is raided, the villagers are taken for slaves and sacrifices, one of them escapes and is chased through the jungle. That's basically it.<br /><br />I'll leave it up to others to say Mel Gibson is bashing paganism, or drawing comparisons with the war in Iraq, or signalling aliens. I say he made a pretty cool movie that is worth a one-time viewing.
An action adventure movie, basically, shot in the lush rainforests of central America.  Stunning set, costume, and makeup design.  You root for the main character, his family, and the others in his simple village, especially when they are attacked by the more powerful Mayans who live in the city.  However....it is extremely gruesome at times for no good reason (leave it to Mel Gibson--he doesn't want you to use your imagination; he has to make you look at the cruelty and the sacrifice and so on; after all, he made TPOTC), and the end leaves you wondering if there was any point or purpose at all.  And what became of the orphaned group of kids?  Well, Mel?
Mel Gibson has done it again.  He has showered us with all sorts of gore.  I wish he had used Mayans for this Mayan story.  He used tall, long-necked Latinos; Mayans are short and do not have necks.  I have been to Yucatan, Guatemala, Honduras many times, but I do not remember seeing high mountains and 200-foot waterfalls in the Mayan world.  He did pick a super hero.  This man took a spear through the abdomen, an arrow through the chest, survived quicksand, and then ran a marathon after being hit in the head several time with a stone axe.<br /><br />If a person knows a little Mayan history, one can fit the film into it, but there is very little story line.
My initial reaction to "Apocalypto" was completely neutral. By that, I don't mean that it was "okay"; I mean that I had no opinion at all. If you had asked me for my thoughts right as I was walking out of the movie theater, I would have told you this:<br /><br />  -- First, when I went into the movie, I was prepared to do a lot of cringing, because I was under the impression that it was at least as gory as "The Passion of the Christ". This is only sort of true. It's certainly as unapologetic about its violence as "The Passion of the Christ". However, in "Apocalypto", this nastiness only occurs in a handful of places, whereas, in "The Passion of the Christ", there are only a handful of places where it doesn't occur. This makes "Apocalypto" a lot easier to watch.<br /><br />  -- Second, it is very artistically made. Considering how so many people are being allowed to produce movies that are obviously going to suck ("Fox and the Hound 2", and virtually everything designed for a teen audience, or to be "fun for the whole family", for instance), a little artistry is a welcome change. This is what I liked about "The Passion of the Christ".<br /><br />  -- Third, it does not generally feel as long as it really is. It's two-and-a-half hours long, but you don't get that fidgety feeling you get in a lot of other long movies.<br /><br />Now that I've thought about it, I have this to say:<br /><br />"Apocalypto" tries very hard to be powerful, deep, and thought-provoking--and it misses the mark on all three. And the sad part is that the only thing that kept it from getting them, and that prevented this from being a fantastic movie, is a good, thorough editing.<br /><br />A lot of material should have been cut, to improve the movie's pacing, which is often glacial, in spite of the fact that there is a lot of action. Some movies, like "2001: A Space Odyssey", are dramatic because they are slow. This one is merely needlessly drawn out. There is even an entire scene, in the very beginning, which should have been removed. First, it is simply not neccessary to the plot. Second, it detracts from the movie's artistry. Third, it leads us to think that the wrong person is the main character. All in all, I imagine that a good twenty minutes of material could have been removed. Some movies need to be long to tell their stories well. This isn't one of them.<br /><br />The movie is self-indulgant in other ways, as well. For example, it opens with a quote, like so many great novels. This would be a clever device if the quote had anything to do with anything that happened anywhere in the movie. That goes for the catch phrase used to advertise it, as well. "No man can escape his destiny". WTF, mate?<br /><br />"Self-indulgant". That's actually a very good way to describe it. Most of plot devices have a sort of.. what's the word? It's as though the script writer was ad-libbing at the typewriter, and the first draft was kept as the final draft. Scenes that should have occured in a different order, omens that hint at one thing, but really mean something else entirely (and you don't even realize it until you think about it, days later), child oracles with absurdly large vocabularies, virtually zero character development.. "Okay, so the bad guys are chasing him through the woods, and.. um.. he suddenly runs out onto a beach and is greeted by Spanish explorers! Yeah."<br /><br />It breaks my heart to say these things, because the movie has so many things going for it. It has an original story, even if it was left extremely undeveloped. The camerawork, the locations, the sets, the costumes--basically everything about its look is wonderful. The actors did a fantastic job with what they were given. And, hey, I appreciated it being in the appropriate language. If you ask me, there aren't too many things worse than seeing a movie that supposedly takes place in, say, Germany, but in which everybody speaks English with a horrendously bad fake German accent.<br /><br />But.. it just leaves one with the sense that it was released prematurely, as an unfinished product.<br /><br />I'd love to recommend this movie to you, but I just can't. If you absolutely have to see it, then wait until you can rent it.
I've been waiting for someone to make a movie about the Maya/Inca civilization. I cant wait to see this!
Having watched this film twice now, I can only give it 3 stars to 3.5 stars because it's kinda like an amusement park ride that isn't quite as "thrilling" the second time around. As beautiful and adventurous as this film is, there is very little emotional resonance, exactly the kind of thing I expected to get. I dunno. All these events and things happening to the one character at one time is really far-fetched and not very beleivable. As compared to the 2 other fantasy/Mayan/Spanish movies that were just released on DVD (Pan's Labyrinth and The Fountain), this one was sadly lacking and I expected it to be the best.
No s&eacute; si la pelicula est&aacute; bien o mal hecha a los ojos de la industria filmica. Lo &uacute;nico qu&eacute; s&eacute; es que Gibson retrata de una manera muy real la vida y costumbres de los mayas antes de que los espa&ntilde;oles nos conquistaran. Que m&aacute;s pod&iacute;amos esperar?? indigenas amigables que com&iacute;an maiz y cazaban con piedras y palos? civilizaciones regidas por leyes provenientes de Europa o Asia? recuerden que la &uacute;nica raz&oacute;n por la que los espa&ntilde;oles decidieron acabar con la cultura y raza indigena fu&eacute; por los sacrificios humanos, ya que en muchas otras cosas los mayas y aztecas eran muy superiores a los europeos en &eacute;sa &eacute;poca.<br /><br />No se dejen llevar por la sangre y crueldad...miren la relaci&oacute;n hist&oacute;rica que tiene la pelicula con lo que hace apenas 500 a&ntilde;os suced&iacute;a en lo que hoy es el Mexico moderno.
I am still undecided about "Apocalypto".  It's a beautifully rendered film with jaw-dropping scenery, moving imagery, and phenomenal characters.  Problem is, I expected this to be completely centered on the legacy of the Mayan civilization and its mythical, mysterious destruction.  If I went to see a film about the Egyptian pyramids, I would hope to leave with some new ideas and perhaps some secret revelations revealed.  While "Apocalypto" does hint at the Mayan downfall with scenes of rotting bodies, disease, and corrupt practices...there is no light shed on why the civilization so abruptly disappeared.  I am not asking for solid evidence of the destruction of a civilization, but perhaps a new theory on "why".  In essence , while the film does a great job of "hinting" the demise of the Mayan empire, it does an even better job of detailing the interactions between the Mayan "kidnappers" and their captives.  The conflict between these two groups reveals some of the most charismatic moments in the film.  I could not get enough of Jaguar Paw, our "jungle hero" fighting for his life against his Mayan nemesis for his life and family.  Surely if these actors were unknowns before this film, they will not be for long.  Gibson has a remarkable way of finding actors with no training and directing Oscar-worthy performances from them.  Like "The Passion", he again succeeds in not only bringing a subtitled film successfully to a mainstream audience, but he introduces to some of the most memorable moments on film delivered by actors unknown to the entertainment world.  Time will tell if this movie will out shadow Gibson's personal demons and I look forward to his next.
While it's fascinationg to see the silver screen decorated by almost naked, exotically beautiful people living the simple jungle life when not taking part in over the top ancient ceremonies....it's unfortunate the story is as uninterestingly predictable and very tedious as the visual effects are eye catching. Mr. Gibson drags out his favorite bits from Mad Max, The Passion of the Christ and his winner, Braveheart,and dresses his cast this time around, in pretty Tribal-Savage-Chic. He also manages to hunt down the greenest, lushest, most cinematic worthy natural forest for the over simplified drama to drag out in. There's plenty of atmosphere alright: you can hear every bird and insect in that overripe steamy jungle, taste the raw organs greedily devoured after a viciously brutal hunt and are repeatedly jolted by the ceremonial blood-centric violence in service to the Mayan gods. The lead, played by Native American Rudy Youngblood (as the super-humanly invincible warrior Jaguar Paw) is as elegantly movie-star handsome a 'savage' as any casting agent can find and paired with his exotically stunning wife and adorable baby son, makes for a mezmerising family (who are lit and filmed most glamorously even while under attack). Mr. Gibson chose to actually build the ancient Mayan city and temples on location as a nod to old-school Hollywood and also heavily researched the details of the ancient ritual heavy culture to ensure historic accuracy.The labor intensive costumes, oversized sets, hundreds of outrageously costumed extras and ceremonial details are impressive...but the few Disney-esque/cute-sy sequences involving CGI animals contrasts too much with the overall serious mood of Mr. Gibson's high speed and violent jungle action-drama. Unfortunately, the Disney-animated-like "ferocious" chief of the murderous tribal thugs who targets the hero,however,is way too overdone and looks more like an L.A. hairdresser out on the fetish-freak-party circuit than ruthless-evil personified. The subtitles lends an air of a documentary, but the spoken language is very flat & emotionless...and the bloody-screams after a while lose their effect. In the end,the romantic art direction and high speed action sequences wins over the weak story...but could make a cool video game for jaded suburban pre-teens with triple ADD!
One of the few movies produced in recent years that doesn't sugar-coat truth so someone somewhere won't be offended.  Fact: The Mayans were a society of God-less murdering pagans, and fanatically true to long established pagan ways practiced by other pagan societies in other parts of the world - including torture, kidnapping, slavery and human sacrifice to home-made gods.  Pooh-pooh on all the rediculous advanced-society nonsense certain historians try to camouflage the true brutality of this society and it's leaders with.  These people knew what they were doing and they knew it was wrong!  The 21st Century is already the most technologically advanced era in human history, with the US the most technologically advanced of all societies on earth. Yet today, true to the natural order of a modern great pagan-society, the US imperial palace has issued a decree to kidnap, torture, hold, lockup, and imprison- for life, so-called "terrorist suspects" in Gitmo and other locations - without charge - without a hearing - without evidence - without counsel - without a trial - forever, and US society as a whole has done nothing but watch it happen at best, or take part in it at worst.  Kidnapping, slavery, torture, imprisonment, death - all state sanctioned just like the Maya, but on a grander scale than the Maya could ever have imagined..., little has changed since the Maya.
It's vintage Gibson. A woman in distress and a hero to save the day. I love most Gibson movies, but I was expecting more about the Mayan downfall.
At the very beginning of this charming little film we are shown a quotation by Will Durant, a deceased philosopher, which says something to the effect that civilizations can not be conquered from without before being corrupted from within.  The effect of this evidently is to lead the filmgoer to the erroneous conclusion that he is about to see something important.<br /><br />It is more than a little amusing that scores of reviewers both professional and amateur have bent their common sense into pretzel shape in order to inform the world of exactly that.  Look, they say, these people are destroying the environment!  Look, they are causing pollution!  Look, they are selling slaves!  Just like us!  How terrible!<br /><br />Not quite.  First of all, the Mayans, (if that indeed is what they are), became a powerful empire because they were stronger and more determined than their enemies.  And despite the fact that they bought and sold slaves and plundered resources from the land and maybe despoiled it, they remained so, for centuries, just like the ancient Egyptians and scores of other cruel, despotic empires over the ages.  Doing these things is NOT what brought them down.<br /><br />No, what brought them down was the fact that they were firmly rooted in the stone-age, technologically speaking, and they were incapable of dealing in a military sense with the arms and armor and gunpowder of the far more advanced Spaniards.  There were other reasons of course, but the idea that they were ripe for conquest because of their barbarism or cruelty to animals or whatever is ludicrous.<br /><br />Of course, this doesn't mean the film should never have been made.  It is indeed an honorable exercise to attempt to recreate in film or print another time and place and doing so accurately can potentially result in great art.  But alas, the film fails here also in that it really doesn't give us anything more than that with which most schoolboys are already aware.<br /><br />Yes, it looks like they got the costumes right, and the Mayan city looks authentic enough, and oh, yeah, there is the human sacrifice thing, but beyond that there is really no insight into Mayan society at all.  We don't get any kind of sense as to what these people think, what they feel, what they wish and what they fear.  Looking at their city is like looking at a postcard.<br /><br />Of course, we do get the perspective of the Mayan captive, Jaguar Paw, who is after all the protagonist of the film.  But he is merely an uninteresting if likeable jungle-denizen, and once he is captured the film essentially becomes nothing more than a horror movie, with ludicrous, over-the-top, often horrific devices thrown in to keep the viewer's blood boiling.<br /><br />Here comes the chopped-off head rolling down the slimy pyramid;  here comes the knife into the heart;  here is a victim impaled by a knife, a spear, an arrow, a stake.  Here is the hero escaping a jaguar, there is the enemy bit by a snake;  here is the hero jumping over a waterfall, there is the enemy caught in a trap;  here is the hero caught in quicksand, there is the enemy killed by a poison dart;  here is the hero's beautiful wife and cute little boy stuck in a pit in the pouring rain with the water rising.  Oooh, what will happen next!  My goodness, it's like watching a Lone Ranger or Batman episode, only gorier and in the jungle.<br /><br />On that meager level this film can be enjoyed, but if one is hoping to learn anything or gain some kind of insight into the ancient Mayan society allegedly depicted here, they will be thoroughly disappointed.
This is probably one of the most bloody movies i have seen and that is saying a lot. Ok, well the acting is amazing and Mel Gibson did a good job on filming the Mayan empire almost exactly as I would imagine it to be. However, does he have to show all the blood when they sacrifice people and such? I could have done without all that. I have enjoyed the movies that Gibson has directed and been in but this movie went too far. Do not go see it if you can't stand for your stomach to turn. It will make you want to throw up.
Mel Gibson, (world famous actor) and now more recently actor turned director of such films as; Brave Heart (director and actor), The Passion of the Christ (director) gives us the story of Apocalypto (director and writer.)<br />I believe that Mel Gibson was intoxicated when that cop pulled him over and during that time the prophecy of making this film came to past, to satisfied the "God's" of  Hollywood.<br /><br />Our movie opens up in the forests of Northern Central American regions.  A group of Mayans are chasing after a Tapir (a pig like animal) and after killing the animal they come across a group of refugees. Jaguar Paw our main character (Rudy Youngblood), decides to ask them where they are going but, his Grandfather Flint Sky (Morris BirdYellowhead) stops him from proceeding with any further questions. When returning back to their village they are enjoying themselves when suddenly they are attacked by a Maya War Party and majority of the women and men are taken back to the Maya City. While they are being taken as prisoners, our hero manages to save his pregnant wife and small child by putting them in a pit.  While traveling to the Mayan Metropolis, they encounter a little girl who spoke about a prophecy (who looks like a younger version of Satan, from Passion of the Christ.) She tells them of a great darkness that will befall the Mayan civilization resulting from a solar eclipse and of a man who will run with the jaguars--in fact, he was being chased by the jaguar. The Mayan war party ignores the little girl's prophecy. Will the prophecy come to past? Will Jaguar Paw escape from his captives and the jaguar? You have to see this movie to fine out!!<br /><br />Mel Gibson the actor (Funny, cool, and a nice guy) but Mel (the director) he is serious, likes history, but he also likes a lot of gore and brutality to help express his story telling.<br />Mel Gibson's direction of Acopatypto is somewhat different then his previous two films; Brave Heart, and  The Passion of the Christ.  In the first he had to show that fighting in battle would present gore and brutality and in the Passion he had to show the realism of Jesus Christ's torturing and most importantly a sadistic nature by the Romans who were torturing him.<br />Now, Mr. Gibson is presenting a movie that we think is about the Mayan civilization, and first off we think that the movie should be about the understanding of the culture, the avant-garde cities, the towering pyramids, their mathematics, and even their astronomy. There are a lot of inaccuracies with this movie as some critics have stated; the architecture, the murals used in the movie (Mel put in extra footage in the paintings), and most importantly their costumes and traditions ( when the Mayans were throwing the bodies off the Pyramids and the female dancers (in which the females didn't participate at in the Mayan rituals) were catching the bodies in big fishing nets.<br />Instead he decides to focus on a similar theme of brutality and gore from his previous two films. You might ask the question, why not?<br />He has a political theme. He compares Mayan human sacrifice with "sending guys off to Iraq for no reason." Folks, after I viewed this film I would have to agree and disagree with Mr. Gibson point of view. First off, let me explain what he is trying to say. He understands (through his research, right!) that the Mayans were pious about offering themselves to their Gods and our Americans soldiers have that same honor and respect for God and our country. That all sounds great but he does not present the Mayans who are being offered to be of a pious nature but that of a slave mentality with a Hostel (the horror film) intent. What people should perceive from his point of view is that senseless killing is going on not only in Iraq but the rest of the world, like Africa. But for the average movie goers they will never understand that there is even a political subtext being considered for this film.<br />Now folks, lets talk about the film itself and boy, there are some problems with this film. His direction has no originality, why? Because, he uses themes from his previous films that he has directed and acted in. One example that comes to mind is the fighting sequences used toward the end of our film. When one of the War party that being the Maya chief (Mauricio Amuy Tenorio) is confronting Jaguar Paw. This is the same exact scene from the movie The Patriot, where Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) is facing off against Benjamin Martin (Mel) and the only difference is instead of a battle field, it is now the jungle. Or, when Jaguar Paw is going to be sacrificed and he has the image of his wife flash into his mind, which is the same thing in Brave Heart. When William Wallace at his execution he sees his dead bride's ghost Murron , (Catherine McCormack) walking through the crowds of people. But what really got my attention is that he had to take themes from Predator and some reminders of Home Alone.  There are several instances for example when Jaguar Paw falls from the water fall or, when Jaguar Paw falls into the mud while running from his pursuers.<br />Or, when Jaguar Paw throws a disguised bee hive at his pursuers and when he takes poison from a frog to use it as a weapon. This has a very similar theme to what Kevin (Culkin) did in Home Alone 1 and 2.<br /><br />Please, if you are going to see this movie with the intent of understanding the Mayan Culture and their advancements. Please stay home because this movie shows brutality and Sadistic brutality with gore. This movie is an insult to the Mayan people because there are still six million descendants still living in Mexico and Central America, who he still has to answer too.
This movie has plenty of quick and violent scenes, and the camera work and shots are excellent, but there is a ton of running, the character development is fair but flimsy, and overall this turns into a 2 hour film of a man running through the jungle.  Very simple premise, simple to watch, worth viewing once.  Not the worst movie of the year, but not the best.
The story telling in Apocalypto is excellent.<br /><br />However, the message the director is trying to send is clearly: "These people deserved to be conquered, and deserved to have their religion largely erased", which is more than a little disturbing.
I've been a fan of Mel Gibson as an actor since "Gallipoli", and thought "Braveheart" was quite good and well directed. The poster for "Apocalypto" featuring what looked like a Mayan warrior with the pyramids in the background got me interested. The only other movies I can remember that dealt with the Aztecs or Mayans were "Captain From Castile" in the 40's and "Kings of the Sun" in the 60's, neither I felt did justice to such impressive civilizations.<br /> I wasn't prepared for how Mel would treat such an advanced culture.<br />Somehow the Mayans were able to build great cities, excel in mathematics and create an early calendar but in this movie they act like the crazies from "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom". They spend their time rounding up innocent natives and bringing them into the great city to be tortured and beheaded. I guess they built those great pyramids so they could roll the heads, hearts and bodies of their sacrifices to the bloodthirsty populace below.<br />It's been a long time since I was so let down by what could have been a great subject. After the main character escapes, the movie reminded me of "The Naked Prey" or "Predator", and the chase is exciting on that level, but why place it during that time and place and ultimately negate the opening quote of Will Durant about a civilization being destroyed from within, when like in "Captain From Castile" it looks like the Spanish got 'em.
I had every intention of giving Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" a chance. I never saw "Passion of the Christ". And I'd like to think I'm capable of enjoying an artist's work despite their personal meltdowns (which is why I can enjoy a Roman Polanski film).<br /><br />"Apocalypto" starts out promising, by introducing the viewer to a likable Mayan village. (Although even in the beginning, jokes about eating testicles and having to procreate in front of your mother-in-law seem to add an unnecessary crudeness). However, as soon as the village is invaded by the ruling Mayan tribe, the film just descends into an orgy of violence, gore and ugliness that just goes on and on and on.<br /><br />By focusing on the characters and using the violence more sparingly, Gibson could have created a better film. But instead, he just throws as much carnage at the screen as he can. A jaguar rips a man's face off. Decapitated heads bounce off a temple. A huge mass grave of headless corpses attract a barrage of flies. After a while, after being assaulted with the relentlessly grotesque imagery, you just become desensitized to it all. And since the characters are never really developed enough for you to really relate to them, the result is that it all just becomes ... tedious.
Fascinating setting, but light on all the other stuff (like story and characters). Although I understand why he used native actors, the acting really was quite bad. The characters were shallow and I had a very hard time sympathizing with them. The story - if you can call it that - had no direction whatsoever. It is as if Mel Gibson threw together some limp-wristed plot to take up space between all the cool details he developed. I honestly thought it was not worth seeing, much less buying.
Mel Gibson is an excellent actor he is more than a star<br />He is also more than amazing director . Sure all his work goes to the top movies ever. No doubt about it ..
I have been a Mel Gibson fan for many years.  I truly loved his movie "Braveheart" based on the true events of William Wallace in Scotland.  I love movies that are based on Fact or true events.  However, his last few movies haven't done it for me.  For instance "The Passion of Christ" a truly wonderful movie, however you missed so much of the movie and the partayal of actual events due to the fact that you had to read each word that was spoken.  The same goes for "Apocalypto" the Movie was a great movie based on an ancient civilization the Mayans.  I watched the movie very intently and I watched the bonus features also.  They spoke of how hard it was to find a location to film, mainly due to the fact that they wanted the viewer to get the feeling of how life was in a dense rain forest and how hard life was, when they had to watch out for each other and other tribes that may want them as slaves.  However, I would have been able to enjoy more of the movie, the location the movie was filmed and the actual events if I didn't have to read each word that was spoken. I understand the desire to make the movie as original as possible, and even the clothing was as original and hand made just for this film, a lot of work and research went into this movie, not excluding the budget.  However, I believe I could have enjoyed the movie more, understood the movie more and how an ancient civilization lived if I didn't have to read each word that was spoken.  I believe that Mr. Gibson should have given the viewer the option as to whether they wanted to view the DVD with the translation, or just have it in english.  I think that we could have got more from the film if we didn't have to continualy read what was being said.  I'm sorry Mel I can't give this movie the rating it should have for that very reason, even though I understand what you and your writers were trying to do.  Mel you are a great Actor and Director, but maybe you need to rethink the way you want your movies to be viewed.  I also believe that because you are such a great actor, you should continue to act in your films, such as "Braveheart".
if you are looking for gratuitous violence in a historically incorrect flic, go for it.  the characters and cinematography is great, the rest is fed to you a la Mel Gibson.  He has a point to make, a visual experience to feed you, and that is about it. I watched the movie, and at the end, the story is neither plausible, nor all that intriguing.  Many of the violent scenes and dialogues are just there for Mel to show you; they do not fit in with the scheme, nor do they answer the so what question.  Not bad visually, but not much of a movie either.
The plot is basically Rambo, with some beautiful scenery and subtitles.  Very gory, but that was the Mayan "civilization."
The Bottom Line:<br /><br />At its best Apocalypto is a kinetic chase film, but the first hour drags something awful and the unnecessary and flawed subplot with Jaguar Paw's wife in the giant hole slowed down the action further; Apocalypto is certainly recommended to action fans, but it's not a very accomplished film.
I already know people are going to rate against me for my statement, but I'm not writing this for them, I'm writing it for cultured people who are tired of inhaling toxic ethnocentrism.<br /><br />In short, the film is about the how horribly savage the Mayans were, living in perpetual hell until the end of the film when the Spaniards arrive on boad holding a cross (must we not forget Gibson is a dedicated Christian) and raises the Mayans not only to true civilization, but introduces them to God.  This is because of course, the Mayans were living without God until the Spaniards came with the blessing to show them God's love and grace.<br /><br />At least that's what Gibson is trying to say and it's also why many people, especially those whose ancestors helped destroy Native cultures, need to believe in order to justify the truly horrible and savage act of genocide and slavery they committed that would make any of the supposed Mayan savagery look like a kid's book.<br /><br />Sorry for the truth but somebody has to say it.
What a missed chance! How is it possible to take a fascinating civilization, spend huge amounts of money on wonderful decors and costumes, get a whole bunch of very good new actors, and then produce a completely forgettable movie?? I am not even talking about the historical inaccuracies (even I know that the Mayas were long over the high point of their civilization before the Spanish arrived - and then, really, isn't that the event when the problems for the indigenous peoples really started?). Or the ridiculous solar eclipse (the moon rather rapidly moves in front of the sun and then obligingly pauses for a while....) The story is just plain uninteresting, the characters flat. Instead of giving us a view of this civilization and how it worked, we see some uninteresting primitive forest dwellers. Characterization?? What characterization??? The villagers are all just Good and the bad guys are Bad. Apparently not even because their god wants them to capture sacrifices, but just because they enjoy Being Bad. No explanation, nothing about How and Why. And then the completely unbelievable feats that the main character performs. After days of abuse and having being shot twice, he still jumps of a huge waterfall and manages to kill his opponents one by one. A predictable and forgettable movie.
While visually satisfying the appetite and creative in that sense, I kept waiting for a point to be made. Like "24" you have to suspend disbelief--a man is tortured, forced to walk for miles and miles through jungle and rapids and hills, no food, no water (no cell phone), shot with a spear through the abdomen, meets up with a panther and outruns him, shot with an arrow through the shoulder, jumps down a massive waterfall, survives all and still outruns several healthy, well equipped (but really lousy shots) and well fed pursuers. The ending was pat and predictable. Enough gore and bloodshed to satisfy even the most hungry mass murderer watching. I kept wondering, what kind of sick mind keeps making the same movie over and over--all Gibson's movies seem to have no other point that to kill and gore and behead and sever as many limbs as possible under the guise of pretending to tell a story.
This may very well be the worst film I've ever seen.  The setting of the Mayans and Aztecs attracted me to the movie in the first place, but it's merely the coat of paint thrown on a completely pointless and barbaric film.<br /><br />From scene one, this movie is grotesque.  Mel attempts to connect us with the Mayans with an opening scene of tricking the fat kid into eating pig balls, then rubbing hot peppers onto his privates.  And it just goes downhill from there.<br /><br />The whole film feels like an excuse to film the horrific acts Gibson seems to have become obsessed with.  Near the end, it's like they suddenly remember they need some sort of confrontation and resolution, and it's like he just went down the list of movie cliches in order.  In two minutes I saw every bad trick to build tension ever concieved.<br /><br />I'm disgusted that Apocalypto is selling so well.  Or even at all for that matter.  It's a horrible film.
What's with Mel Gibson and all these violent movies? Does he try to top himself each time? Take away the violence and how many people would really go to see this movie? Seriously? Better yet, take away Mel Gibson's name and how many people would go to see this movie? I'm hoping, one day, he'll make a movie that normal people can enjoy.
First of all, i will like to thank director mel gibson, for bringing a piece of hispanic culture to the big screen and to the whole world...Hispanics get secondary roles in hollywood, like for example ( HOUSEMAIDS!!!!!!!!!  JANITORS!!!!!!!  LAWNMOWER MEN, THE TYPICAL LIMOUSINE DRIVER!!!!!!! THATS VERY IGNORANT FROM HOLLYWOOD!!!!! well finally we get to show some talent, self-respect, and culture with apocalypto...even thou its not that loyal to the real thing, but it represents for sure.... another hit is PANS LABYRINTH...made by hispanics, for hispanics, ( i guess no english dubbing on this one) which is good...!!!!!!!
A pre-title quote leads one to believe that this story will have something to do with how a civilization is only conquered if it is already corrupt from within (which is like saying a good person never gets beat-up unless he is really bad inside anyway), as if being a more primitive civilization had nothing to do with the Mayan's being conquered by the Europeans. This is filmmaker Gibson's simpleton logic, and it makes for a dull and plastic film. Nothing rings true: Even the dialogue as translated in the subtitles seems to be from some elementary school production. Other than nice location photography, nothing looks right and nothing sounds right. And, somewhere in the middle of the film, popping out of nowhere, comes some child foretelling the future for no logical reason other than to have it come true -- Gibson moral fantasy? I did not feel that I was experiencing nor learning anything about the Mayan culture. To say I did learn anything from this film would be like saying that I learned much about Africa from watching TARZAN AND HIS MATE, but, at least, the old Weissmuller jungle movie was exciting and entertaining (and had far more interesting characters, including the apes).
I just finished watching this movie.  I agree with another viewer that Gibson should have spent more time developing the characters.  Most of this movie was a long and boring chase scene.  There didn't seem to be a real plot going on. Don't waste your time.  I am not motivated at all to watch any of Mel Gibson's films in the future.
I really had looked forward to seeing a movie about the Maya, an exotic advanced, civilization living in the jungles of Mexico and Guatemala that had flourished and then mysteriously disappeared.  If you were like me and thought that the movie was named "Apocalypto" because it would be an epic about the demise of the Maya civilization, you were wrong.<br /><br />Problems with the movie:<br /><br />1. No indication when this takes place. The viewer would have no way of knowing if this was today in the Amazon jungle or 4000 years ago.  Only at the very end do you get any indication of the date of this movie.<br /><br />2. The movie has NO story.  The whole movie is just one long chase seen, with the main character defying unbelievable odds.<br /><br />3. Tons of blood and guts, killing, raping, and cruelty that will turn many people off.<br /><br />4. Predictable.  I guessed how the main character was going to not get sacrificed and what he would see at the end that would shock and save him.  (This final scene was hardly Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes).<br /><br />5. Historical and location inaccuracies.  The movie shows a 700 AD Classic Maya ceremonial center in Guatemala, but ends on the beach in 1530 Yucatan.  I could forgive these, if the movie was about something, more than a chase.<br /><br />6. Almost nothing about the Maya.  90% of this movie takes place in the jungle and not in the Mayan city.  We know the history of the Maya because their writing has been deciphered.  The Maya were such an interesting culture to do a movie about.  This was ancient Egypt in the jungle, ruled by warlike god-kings, with great pyramids, temples, irrigation works, and an exotic religion.  This could have been an epic movie, the "Moses" or "Ben Hur" of the jungle instead Gibson centers his movie on a poor village of hunters and gathers getting pillaged by the bad Maya.  This is like trying to make a "Gone With the Wind" and center the story around a family of poor tenant farmers.  Not very exciting stuff!<br /><br />Overall, bad movie, skip it.<br /><br />Does anyone know a good movie about the Maya written history?  If not I'd even enjoy a documentary detailing their history of conquests and exotic culture?
I've always been a Mel Gibson fan (Braveheart, The Patriot, The Mad Max Movies, We Were Soldiers, etc) but this film is just plain horrible. Don't fall for the hype and waste your money on it.  Mel needs to give up directing and get back to acting.  I rate it a 0 out of 10.
I didn't buy this movie on regular DVD because I DID NOT WANT TO READ THE MOVIE I wanted to watch it and listen to it!!!  I bought this movie on Blue Ray because the case said it had an optional 5.1 English sound track --- but it did not!  Both the uncompressed sound track and the 5.1 sound track are in the obscure language.  The only English sound track is the commentary by the director.
I think that this was probably one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time..... I can't believe that such a thin plot could be considered anything but rubbish!  While beautifully filmed, and including some excellent actors, there just really is nothing to this story, regardless of how much blood and gore is thrown across the screen.  Man is captured, his village wiped out and taken to a Mayan capital for sacrifice.  He escapes, runs home while being chased by Mayan warriors, runs into Spanish conquistadors when about to be finished off, rescues his wife and kids and then wanders back into the jungle.  That's it!  When I think how much more could be done with this time in history and location, it makes me weep.... I strongly recommend you get a copy of 'Atztec' by Gary Jennings to get an idea of what has been missed!
I was really disappointed with Apocalypto.  I heard lots of good things from my friends and made the mistake of buying it without having seen it first.  There is no story in this movie.  It's moderately impressive visually, but Mel Gibson doesn't seem to understand that a lot of pretty pictures do not a movie make.  It is more impressive that the main character (whatever his name is) is in virtually every shot, and yet still he is somehow not developed at all.  The movie had me bored to tears and watching it I did nothing but ask myself for two and a half hours why it was ever filmed.
Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is terrible. Gibson's perpesctive of mayan culture was interesting up until the point he decieded to brutaly murder the tribe. He uses disturbing directing tactics in Apocalypto to manipulate your emotions. For instance when the tribe is invaded, Gibson sets up "emotional killings." The son watches his fathers throat get cut, the lover watches as the tribesmen rape and abuse his love. These are cheap tactics to make you care about the events on an emotional level. Overall I hated this movie. If you want a good flick by talented directors watch No Counrty for Old Men.
Gibson obviously believes in human value through suffering, so much so that his movies are starting to look more like random scenes from a Pasolini adaption of the writings of Marquis de Sade.<br />There's a diminishing sense of purpose or resolve for his characters in his directorial output, a psychological disconnect, a lack of empathy where suffering is a goal unto itself. Everybody just needs to get punished in his movies, it seems.Possibly for the crime of being human.<br />You know;-Original sin.<br />The younger or more innocent the victim, the harsher the torture. Human degradation meticulously recorded and catalogued.<br />With the now trademark extended-slow-motion-torture-scenes-of-innocents-in-lush-rainy-landscapes he seems more and more to forget to actually tell a story. Let alone let justice be served.<br />Compared to other directors focusing on ethics like for instance Clint Eastwood, where you get a sense of purpose and justice through it all, Gibson comes off like like an old fire and brimstone preacher. Without the redemption part.<br />Don't get surprised if his next project is a 3 hour+ epic retelling of Noa's Ark.<br />Then he can actually (slowly)kill off almost everyone on this whole bastid planet.<br />The first 20 minutes of the movie would be old N stoically hammering away in the rain.Token intro done with and the funfest starts:<br />People of all creed and race; slowly flailing men,women and children coughing,crying in the rain and drowning, pleading to no avail.Pan and scan, the whole world. Drowning.<br />-Mothers giving birth whilst drowning; going under, newborn bobbing up to the surface, -a glint of hope; getting dragged down after the mother by the umbilical-cord. Camera following down in the churning waters cataloguing every dying spasm of the baby. And so on for three hours-. The last 40 seconds will show a small plant sticking out of the water.<br />Gibson gets another Oscar.
I had looked forward to viewing this film for several months.  When I was finally able to check it out of the library I was excited to watch it; however, I did not even finish watching it.  Although the cinematography was captivating, this was a horrible movie.  The violence was extreme and hard to sit through.  In addition, the portrayal of the Mayan culture is inaccurate.  I can't recall the last movie I was not able to sit through a movie.  Quite disappointing......
This movie is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I could give it less than 1 star, I would. If you like watching body parts being eaten, and people having their heads cut off, you might like it. I watched about an hour of the movie and couldn't take it anymore.
I watched this movie on cable last night and was appalled (albeit grateful that I didn't waste any money on it!). I don't even know where to begin criticizing: the historical and anthropological inaccuracy? The unconvincing characters? The predictable plot? The overall unbelievable story that depends on coincidences like, for example, a total eclipse of the sun, conveniently occurring while the main protagonist is about to be disembowelled?<br /><br />What's the purpose of this film? Are we supposed to think that the Mayas were cruel slave owners whose empire fell apart because of mass sacrifices? That they needed to be "civilized"? That they deserved to be conquered and enslaved themselves?<br /><br />I could go on and on, but this quote from a review by XeniaisGod on IMDB sums it up nicely for me: "Why disguise a C-level slasher flick as an historical epic? If your true calling as a director is directing films that are thin on plot and gratuitously violent, why not just direct The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part Deux?"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fact that all characters speak native languages adds a realistic feel to this production. I wouldn't be surprised if most people walked away from it with the impression that the Maya were some sort of meso-American Romans. Sad!<br /><br />And as an afterthought: I wish it were possible to brainwash film directors so that they never use the "pregnant woman goes into labor in the middle of a crisis" scene again. Ever.
I was unable to watch this movie because it didn't have the correct "region code". I just got a blu-ray player, so I am relatively new to this whole experience. My only advice would be to make sure your Blu-ray player will play this disc before you buy it.
Of all the beauty there is in this world, it is very hard for me to imagine a group of people spending their time and money and other resources to create a movie with such extreme violence. Is it just for the money or do these people get pleasure from creating and watching violence. I could not watch more than 15 minutes of this movie and I'll never see another movie that is connected to Mel Gibson or anyone else who was a part of this project. Also historically speaking this movie cannot be further from the truth. Fantasy? well I'd call it a nightmare.
While I watched this movie I couldn't help feel like I was watching a bad remake of Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom. Cut out a man's heart and watch him squirm as you raise it up to the gods. At least the Indiana Jones movie was fun. This is a movie with a story line that has been told a hundred different times in a hundred different ways. The bad guys attack the good guys, kill a whole bunch of people, take some prisoners. The good guy then goes on to escape killing those who pursue him while rescuing his wife who he had hidden from the bad guys. Writers with talent are non existent these days, it's all special effects, forget about an original story. Tell the same story in a slightly different way, in a different time period, using a different culture, add a few special effects, advertise it heavily, and make a few hundred million in the process.<br /><br />The animatronics used for the animals in the movie were so phony I couldn't help laughing. Disney is obviously heading down the tubes. Some reviews rave about the scenery but I saw nothing special about it. It was a whole lot of jungle with some special effects of Mayan buildings, and Mayan costumes, nothing great.<br /><br />There is plenty of action in the movie and it is fast paced. If you don't care about a good story and just want to see plenty of action and special effects then you will probably enjoy this movie.
After about 45 minutes I'm reaching for the fast-forward because it began to seem pointless. Despite some incredible production, amazing sets, and realism, the story lacked depth and interest. The blood and guts seemed gratuitous. Bummer- I expected more from Mel Gibson.
Yet another aimless, overwrought, adolescent Gibson film. Some directors nowadays let the technology take over their films. Gibson lets his production designers make his movies. Just add endless gore, and raging actors, and boom, another 50 million dollar drive-in movie. Somebody stop this man before he films again.
I don't care if it was Mel Gibson who directed this gore fest.<br /><br />Any movie, directed by anyone, that has this amount of stabbing, mutilating, raping, maming, slicing and gratuitous violence should have flopped in the box office. But, as we can see by the reviews posted here, people seem to enjoy this kind of lunatic enterprise.<br /><br />The trouble was they gave an Oscar to Gibson for "Braveheart". So he thought (correctly, apparently...): "Blood is the way to go. I found my niche." What a shame tha a director / actor so rich spends his money to create this nauseous films. I just cannot understand.
I'm not even going to begin dismantling all the historical inaccuracies of Mel Gibson's crazed warping of the Maya. It's too easy, too time-consuming, and so many other people have done it already. But the entire movie can be summed up with one word :insulting.<br /> It's insulting to me, that Mel Gibson thinks he can wow me with his "shock-factor" depictions of such violence and brutality, that does nothing to enhance the story, or the viewer's experience. It's insulting to me that he can throw his lying crap in my face and expect me to buy his portrayal of the Pre-colombian Maya civilization (and yes, he's expecting it, or else he wouldn't have filmed the movie in half-broken Yucatec Mayan with mostly Mexican actors). But Most of all... it's insulting to the more than 7 million ethnic Maya people alive today who are the direct descendants of the ancient Maya. These people are repressed, abused, and shafted enough today, that further contributing to the warping of their ancestor's perceptions is like saying the Jews got what they deserved (not a big stretch from what we know of Mel Gibson anyway). The ethnic Maya people today should be proud of their heritage, not subjected to the crazed, and gore-ridden lunacy depicted in Apocalypto. If you like meaningless violence, drastically false characterization of an entire people, and a plot line worthy of my most pungent punk, then this movie is for you.<br />  For everyone else, I can only recommend staying away if you value your sanity.
I will never purchase another DVD from Amazon again.  My DVD player is just fine and plays many other videos just fine.  This brand new, out of the box video, paused at least 5 times throughout the video making the getting through the video difficult at best.  DO NOT PURCHASE DVD'S FROM AMAZON!!!
I don't know whether Mel Gibson had "It" to begin with, but who cares, because he's officially lost it with this meandering, heartless film about the decline of the Mayan civilization. Whether or not the actual Mayan civilization was like this is of course open to debate (and historians HAVE been debating this over and over since the films' release) - but what we have here borders on lunacy (and not even in a nice way).<br /><br />The story is simple - a tribe is captured to be offered as sacrifice to the Mayan Gods, and one man (i.e "The Chosen One" like Neo from "The Matrix") saves them all (sort of). Well at least he manages to save himself and his family. There is even a ridiculous child Oracle (again, like "The Matrix") who predicts the coming of the Chosen One.<br /><br />Thrown in an Eclipse, a black Jaguar, some quicksand, and lots of blood and hearts (literally) thrown around, and you have "Apocalypto" down pat. This is not a film for the faint of heart, but its not much of a film either. Rudy Youngblood (who is busy convincing us all in real life of his Native Indian roots) plays the young man who is the Neo of his generation, and the second half descends into a senseless chase - one disaster after the other, and oh, did I mention the blood and visceral body parts?<br /><br />The sad part of this whole thing is that it *could* have been tolerable had we given this project to a better director. Mel Gibson clearly has problems with race, religion and the universal belief system. At the end, the Mayans come across as Godless, barbaric and mindless creatures who 'deserved' to be conquered by the white race. Obviously this is not a good message.<br /><br />A very poor film - even purely as an action film, it falters quite badly. Very mildly recommended. Also, I thought the casting was WAY off - not at all convincing.
This movie was very disappointing.  If you want to watch a movie about a mayan (long haired mexican/indian) getting captured, then released, and then chased through the jungle, then this movie is for you.  Yawn.
This was not the type of movie that was so bad it became funny, it was so bad it became exhausting.  I never thought a movie this violent could also be this BORING.  The movie had no point, it was a long snuff film set at the end of the Mayan civilization (vaguely, historically accuracy is fuzzy at best).
Another horrific bloodbath of a movie based on historical fiction by the infamous Mel Gibson. He has enough money to keep making movies, but do you really need to subject yourself to the nauseating stuff he comes up with?  Save your money for a good movie instead!
I'm still shocked that I wasted over 2 hrs watching this film. Even though there may have been some truth to this film, I didn't see the point in reliving this on the big screen. Only drawn out suffering of innocent people... again WHAT'S THE POINT??!!!  I totally agree with kindasortas review "Unless you enjoy beheadings (complete with heads rolling down stairs multiple times), human slaughter, animal slaughter (complete with consumption of animal genitalia), human sacrifice, hearts ripped out (multiple times), human torture, viewing large pits of decaying corpses, rape, and burning bodies...then avoid this waste of film." Nothing but negativity about this film--A GREAT DISSAPOINTMENT.
Great Action, great story but the movie had NO ending.  I wasted 2 hours of my life.
The first scene they hunt this wild pig, kill it, then they cut the testacles off it and make one of the guys eat them in hopes that he will be able to get his wife pregnant.  They actually showed him eating the balls...gross.  I promptly removed it from the PS3, put it in the Netflix envelope and sent it back.  It is beyond me why you'd open a movie like that.
This movie portrays one gruesome act after another to the extent that it is boring.  It drives home the theme of man's inhumanity to man over and over and over.  If I could have given it 0 stars I would have.<br /><br />Also this movie is entirely subtitles.<br /><br />I'm not a Mel Gibson fan anymore but tried it because I have Netflix and the Starz movies, of which this is one, will be deleted from the selections after Feb. 28, 2012.  I'm trying to watch as many, that are interesting, as possible prior to the cutoff. I watched about 20 minutes of it and decided to try another selection.<br /><br />If I had known how dull it was, I would not have bothered. I'm writing this review in hopes that I can save others from wasting their time.
There is no doubt that this film is absolutly gorgeous and detailed.<br />So much so that I fear for the faint of heart. (Remember those folks<br />who collapsed during "The Passion," the other Gibson tour de farce?)<br />The violence is so unrelenting, the savagery so graphic, one has to<br />wonder how the Mayans survived themselves for a thousand years!<br /><br />The film made me wonder if Gibson found one redeeming feature in all<br />of Mayan culture. The message seems to be that the Mayans should be<br />grateful for the Spanish invasion. That their civilization required<br />the Catholic Church to come and destroy it.<br /><br />Gibson seems to be using the Mayans as a metaphore for today's world.<br />That without the church, we are nothing but beasts. At the heart of<br />it, this movie is pro-colonialization. Those who know better, the<br />Catholic Church for example, SHOULD invade and conquer where ever and<br />whoever, for the poor, witless non-believers' own good!<br /><br />I think it take extraordinary chutzpa on the part of Mel Gibson, or<br />any film maker, to promote such arrogant and, frankly, dangerous ideas.<br /><br />Two thumbs down for this movie's message and deliberate intent to<br />portray the Mayan culture as essentially worthless. At the end of it,<br />I asked myself if I had learned one new item about Mayans. The answer<br />was "NO!" However, if I had been inclined to think Mr. Gibson was<br />just a bigot, this movie certainly shows the true depth of his<br />racism. What a shame.
This is the kind of movie that uses pure gore, violence and creepiness to draw attention to itself. Nowadays movies that appeal to  primitive emotions of human beings like savageness, sadism, hatred and intense violence for its own sake seem to make big hit. Other examples include "Kill Bill" and "300". Probably we should build a Colosseum and have naked people fight with lions to death.
Dear Sir/ Madam<br /><br />I have not received my product till now. Please do the needful at your earliest.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Rakesh Kumar Handa
This was so violent- depressing.. that I threw it away.. after about 15 min. of viewing it..<br /><br />NOT THE fault of AMAZON... IT CAME in a timely manner... but I will read reviews more thoroughly in the future before making purchases.....IT WAS even too violent to pass  on to friends@@
I'm sorry I bought this film. Seems Gibson is fixated on oral sex and portrays the Mayan's as a bunch of rowdy soccer fan types.
This movie was...uhh....intresting but lacked any historical accuracy. More research should of been done on this movie before it was made. There were HUGE inaccuracies in this movie. The Mayan cities were abandoned atleast 600 years before the arrival of spaniards. This would be like putting Moses in The Passion. Anyone that knows anything about pre-columbian meso-america will be disappointed by this movie. Although there was a touch of barbarianism in this culture (as there was in every culture) they were not the primative cavemen Mel made them out to be. In alot of ways, they were further evolved than their european counterparts.
After watching this film, I didn't remember which film had won the best Oscar for 2006. I looked it up: Departed. Huh?<br /><br />Martin Scorsese is a fine film maker, but come on, he should hand over his statue to Mel Gibson, because in 2006, he directed the best film.<br /><br />Wow...what a movie, I just finished watching it. Who is that actor that has the speed and grace of Ronaldinho? Rudy Youngblood, himself a Native American.<br /><br />Gibson seems to have a knack for stories of men's journey from point A to point B. This movie is no exception. It seemed the pages of National Geographic had just come alive.<br /><br />Each new chapter of humanity starts with a clean slate, to be better, to beget life, to provide liberty and to pursue happiness. Gibson catches that whiff of a page turning to a new beginning.
This is hands down the best movie I have seen/purchased in so long! Apocalypto is an amazing epic that will have you both astonished and on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Apocalypto is unlike any movie I have ever seen. It's like being on a rollercoaster in a sense that you are feeling pure adrenaline! Mel Gibson did a an amazing job. The actors, the makeup, wardrobe, the camera work, the directing, the location etc....was all brilliant. WOW!!!<br /><br />I don't want to say too much about the movie itself to the point where I give things away but, it follows the "ins" and "outs" of the Mayan culture. This movie makes you feel like you are right there with them. It is in subtitles but, they do not speak that much - the action is what tells the story. Action DOES speak louder than words. It is breathtaking!!!<br /><br />****A TIP*******<br /><br />I bought this movie when it came out this past Tuesday and I have since watched it 2 times. The DVD has bonus material and one them is "Creating Apocalypto" - I recommend watching that. It tells a lot about how it came to be and how everyone was transformed into character. After I watched the movie once, I then watched it again a few days later after seeing what that bonus feature told me.<br /><br />This movie is pure genuis, entertaining and a must see!!!!
Forget Gibson, see this film for the acting!<br /><br />All I keep hearing is how disturbingly and needlessly violent people find this movie,I don't understand this. An unprovoked attack on a sleeping village. cold blooded murder,and rape. followed by brutal captivity, all leading up to mass human sacrifice. I don't see how it could have been done another way. What I mean is, if the violence and atrocities. had been merely suggested or just touched upon. we as the viewers would have no more the a vague passing notion of the horrorific inhumanity terror and soul crushing hoplessness that Jaguar Paw and his people faced. In short we were meant to share in these experiences, and feel exactly as they felt.<br /><br />That being said, this movie is more then violence.<br /><br />Rudy Youngblood as Jaguar Paw is, so overwelmingly powerful and supernaturally driven(No pun intenened) there is no way to accurately describe his performance, it must be seen and felt.<br /><br />Dalia Hernandez as Seven is, My personal favorite. Her gentleness and determination, I often wanted to return to the well,even though so much else was happening.<br /><br />Another standout performance for me was, Morris Birdyellowhead as Flintsky, Jaguar Paw's father. A lot of power packed in a short amount of screen time, and one of the best on screen death scenes I've ever seen.<br /><br />As a whole this movie is impressive to say the least. but for me it was a hundred small moments a look, between two people a line of dialogue. The old stoy teller, the children who were left behind, the dying little girl and her prophecy, and so many others that made this a worth while experience. I'll be waiting for the dvd.
I hadn't heard of this movie until I saw it on cable and I have to say that Mel did a excellent job with this movie about the fall of the Mayan Civilization. The actors were so fabulous that I thought he may have taken a clip from a live tribe. The action, top notch. I'd recommend to anybody looking for an action packed adventure.
Apocalypto is one of those films that deserves thought over it. Oddly enough, it is also one of the few films with depth that can also evoke immediate responses. As testament to that, you can see the many visceral reactions that came out at the time of the films release.<br />Oddly enough, as impactful as the film is in terms of the violence and the ferocity of the performance, I can still safely say that many aspects were held back, I would guess for censorship reasons, and probably because Mel Gibson wanted the film to do well at the box office. The Combination of Actors, animals, practical effects, animal puppets, over 400 Visual FX shots, give rise to a near perfect illusion of the frenetic paced action which is this story.<br />I can but urge you to see this film. Then listen to the DVD  commentary, and see the far too short Features on the one disk.<br />THE DVD: Great Visuals, great sound, and another near perfect film done by a Master Craftsman in the world of popular film.<br /><br />ENJOY
If Mel Gibson's fourth film, Apocalypto, doesn't jolt your nervous system, shoot up your heart rate, and keep your attention fully within its chokehold, nothing will. Take my word for it, this is not picnic for the softhearted. So, either welcome its brutal shot of adrenaline with open arms or go watch something else that's not even half as intense.<br /><br />Apocalypto gives us a full-blooded tour through the Mayan civilization, something I'd studied back in the sixth grade and nearly died of boredom, unaware of how its gonna come back to haunt me twenty years later and give me the time of my life. It's a movie that gives you one violent shove into the Mayan's dog-eat-dog world where you're bound to be chased, killed, kidnapped, or run off your land with more than just a flesh wound.<br /><br />The action is dynamite! You don't just watch it; you actually feel like you're running along. But action or no action, every moment counts as much as the next. There's excellent use made of the production, the sights, the sounds, to give you the most vivid, lively, and emotional experience as you can imagine.<br /><br />Whether or not the things that take place in this film have happened in real life is unimportant here. This is a movie, not a history book. So, spare me whatever criticism you may have on the movie's historical accuracy, and instead learn to appreciate what's accurately there in front of you.<br /><br />Then again, with a movie this gripping, I don't think anyone would have the nerve to think of anything else but what they're going through. Believe me, there's hardly any room left for popcorn.
My father saw Apocalypto, bought the movie, and demanded I watch it.  So on Christmas Eve, my brother, my father, and I gathered around to watch a heartwarming family movie about human sacrifice.<br /><br />I knew a lot more about Aztec and Mayan culture than my relatives, so much of what happened (or was about to happen) took on special significance for me.  When Jaguar Paw's (Rudy Youngblood) tribe is attacked by the Aztecs and carried off instead of killed, we know it's not to live a life of slaves.  It's something much worse.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife and young child manage to evade capture by lowering themselves into a well, but they're trapped there. If it rains, they drown.  If the Aztecs find them, they're sacrificed. And thus we have a race against time, as Jaguar Paw must both escape captivity and pursuit, all in an effort to save his young family from certain doom.<br /><br />Apocalypto encompasses everything you ever wanted to know about Aztecs.  It's all here: black panthers, Aztec martial prowess, steaming jungles, ziggurats, and a twist ending that ties it all neatly in a historical bow.  If the movie wasn't so violent, high school teachers every would be showing this movie as a snapshot of history.<br /><br />The violence is actually not that bad.  A scene where an Aztec is mauled by a panther is more graphic than the heart sacrifices performed atop the grisly temples. Much more exciting are the thrilling chase and combat sequences, some of the best on foot.<br /><br />Given that this is a film about a time before modern convention, it's amazing how Gibson fits in movie conventions usually associated with car chases.  There are twists in Jaguar Paw's escape and his hunt by the Aztecs that are worthy of any action movie.<br /><br />Did I mention that this entire movie is subtitled?  The movie's so enthralling that you stop noticing it a few seconds in. Apocalypto's that good. Sure, it's a blood-drenched action thriller in another language.  But what did you expect from Mel Gibson?
Even though I loved Braveheart and The Passion, I did not see this movie on the big screen because I listened to the media bash its violence and gore and make it sound meaningless and even unwatchable.  After watching this movie 4 times in last week (and for the first time), I absolutely, positively have put it at the top of my greatest movies ever list (just above The Godfather, Gladiator, The Usual Suspects and To Kill a Mockingbird).  You will be hooked on it immediatley due to character development and the dialogue.  You are then taken on an amazing trhrill ride with an incredible plot (I won't disclose anything for those who have not seen it).  Its more a drama than an action movie.  The scenery and filmography are amazing, and its meanings are timeless.  Everyone I have ever talked to who has actually SEEN the movie and not listened to media based Gibson bashing completely agrees.  See it!<br />ps.<br />My wife felt the exact same way!
Those who gave this movie 1 star seem<br /><br />1. Obsessed with Gibson's money.<br />2. Mel is permanently in the dog house because he makes movies that show Christianity as the hope of the world.<br />3. They find it racist to point out that this culture actually could be as violent as it was.<br /><br />Hello?!? Not all cultures like our own - that have a christian foudation - had a natural human tendency toward a respect for life.  Throughout human history life had little to no meaning to nearly every culture until Christianity arrived and the hearts of those in the culture were changed.  Sorry folks if the facts get in the way of your wishful thinking.<br /><br />This movie was very good.  The whole thing was subtitled, just like The Passion, which again gave it the feel that you were actually watching the real deal.<br /><br />Yes this movie was graphically violent but and some scenes were troubling (especially those involving children being hurt or abandoned) but should Gibson have re-written history and made the story nicer so as to pacify those who refuse to believe that there were societies that had no respect for life.<br /><br />This is a great story and a fascinating psuedo-history lesson.  I enjoyed it for what it was - a very entertaining adventure film.  Folks, the comfortable world we live in today is unique and sorry if the world was not always like that.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
Another reviewer on here said, "Say what you will about Mel Gibson. He makes great movies." This is absolutely true. Apocalypto has an amazing story as well as great action and suspense. It's something fresh and new. To top it all off, it is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The jungle and landscape shots are breathtaking. The detail on the Mayan people's faces are incredible.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought the violence and brutality were a bit excessive for my taste. So be warned: if you're squeamish at the sight of blood and gore, this might not be the movie for you.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great "demo" Blu-ray to show off your TV, as well as a really fun movie to watch, look no further!
......strip him, paint him blue, cut his heart out, chop his head off, and save us all from any more of his stupid,<br /><br />loud, violent, bloody movies! I just wish there was 0 stars for this one - a complete waste of talent, time, effort, and money. Do youself a favor and skip this one - I sure wish I had!
I was actually excited about this movie from the previews.  I thought it was going to show the chain of events that led to the downfall of the Mayan civilization.  Instead, it was a movie that followed one guy for pretty much one day.<br /><br />There were no twists or surprises, pretty much every "twist and turn" was exactly what you would have expected, and the big surprise ending was lame and didn't really fit into any of it.  However, if the ending was the beginning and it went from there, might have been a good movie.<br /><br />The makeup was horrible, it basically looked like like someone held a stick to a person's nose using play dough and called it makeup.<br /><br />I will admit there were some moments in the film where I laughed, but I was later told it was very inappropriate of me.  Oh yeah, on another note,  lots of men without pants on.  Not exactly the highlight of the film.<br /><br />In all honestly, the most entertaining part of the film was the credits when I saw one of the people's real name is Birdyellowhead.
He obviously gets off on carnage. This pointless and grossly historically distorting, chauvinistic flick is another proof of it. I gave it one star for some beautiful scenery.
The one star rating is meaningless - I had to give the film some rating to submit the review.<br />This film may be wonderful. I wouldn't know. I do my best not to buy or watch work from rabid racist anti-semites. I haven't seen Triumph of the Will or Olypiad. Most likely am missing some very important visual art. And I most likely have bought, used and seen all sorts of work by people who were/are racists.Just try my best not to support such people. There are enough film and other masterpieces out there that I will never have time to experience them all. I will never have the time - after all, starting all the wars - and he meant it - is a rather considerable undertaking.
This could be a excellent movie if it was in english and not just english subtitles...Wake up mel enough is enough.
Do not waste one penny of your money or one minute of your life on this sickening, psychotic, repulsive piece of garbage! Spend your money on ANYTHING ELSE & you will be better off. Who, other than Mel Gibson, or the next Jeffrey Dahmer could watch this & find it entertaining?
While it's not on par with his last two directorial efforts (the epic "Braveheart" and the soul-stirring "The Passion of the Christ"), Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" is a well-made historical film set during the final days of the Mayan empire. The cast and crew do a fine job of bringing the world of the Mayan to life. While the second act of the film gets long after a while, the final hour of the movie is rousing and exciting. And the unexpected ending will leave everyone wide-eyed. Fans of Gibson's previous work will enjoy "Apocalypto."<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+
This one is a very interesting film. I am half Mexican, so I have certain knowledge of this issue. The film is set in an undefined historical period; only at the magnificent end we have an idea of the age (which obviously I do not intend to mention), and deals with the story of a peaceful tribe whose members are captured, turned into slaves, and eventually sacrificed to the gods. The images are great, and the life in a Mayan society cannot be better expressed. Obviously the film is not completely accurate, because the zenith of the Mayan culture was ca. AD 900, and thereafter the decadence was so obvious that at in the last stages most of the culture (astronomy, mathematics, for instance) had been lost, and the cities were depopulated. But the concept of the film is striking: the reasons why a culture created the roots of its self-destruction. The fact that the film is spoken in Yucatan's Mayan dialect is very important, because it provides a sense of reality. The film is seen from the Indian point of view, without foreign influences. Obviously the Mesoamerican cultures of the period were very savage in some aspects: they had great scientific advances, but their religion was unhuman, and, strangely, they still were in the very Stone-Age (much developed, but, for instance, without knowing the wheel). The end of the film is striking, and resembles me the final beach scene of the "Planet of the Apes" with Charlton Heston, but with a more promising message, much in common with Mel Gibson's clear religious position. I liked the end very much, and probably it is one of the most important assests of the film. For me, being partly Mexican, it is an important point.
Hey, I bet you are here looking for a movie to get. I know you here about all these movies, how good they are, and you think that its all hype.  Well, I can tell you that I was thinking the same thing about this movie before I got it.  When, I got this movie and watched it though I was surprised. Really, really surprised. The movie was a really good adventure in which one man tries beyond human endurance to save his family. The struggle this one man endures to accomplish this is thrilling and invigorating. The result of this fact is that you watch the movie, and never really think about how long it is, or how much time you spent watching the movie. The scenery was great, and the dialogue was even better, so  in the end you have a really good movie which is a pleasant story. Get it and enjoy!!!!!!
If you've just bought a blueray player or a PS3, you must buy this movie not only as a spectacular technical demo.  But as a great movie to watch aswell.  Following in Mel's tradition of brutality of his previous two films.  If you don't like gore then this movie might not be for you.  It has alot of brutally realistic violence.<br /><br />Back to the beauty of this film.  It's got lush greens, rivers, colorful makeup design, and spectacular detail in the face close-ups.  It looks better than real, it's so sharp.  The detail of the blueray gets a 5, and so does the movie.  For it's riveting tale of revenge.  Those of you who liked revenge stories IE: Man on Fire should really like this one too.
You probably won't recognize any actors, but quite frankly it doesn't matter, Mel Gibson directs another outstanding film.  I would not recommend this movie for a family movie night- there is a lot of gore, but horror movies are more excessive than this movie is and it has a mysterious story and an interesting prespective from the natives who are caught up in a genocide, yet do not realize a different enemy creeping in...<br /><br />Yea, I didn't even see this movie in theaters and I knew I wanted it on DVD.  I got it for my birthday two years ago and watched it that night!  I wasn't disappointed... though my wife will never watch it with me again...(not a good date night movie either)
if you are tired and bored by the same predictable garbage called 'movies' today, APOCALYPTO might be the remedy. From the first scene to the last, this movie is magnetic/thrilling/electric/eye-popping. I tried to watch ' 10,000 BC ' after Apocalypto; it was like reading a bad comic book. I noticed that some of the reviewers fixated on silly, tiny moments in the film to make points or criticize. Don't listen to them.  Near the middle of the movie there is a scene of life around the bases of the Mayan pyramids... IT IS LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE !!! George Lucas and Steven Spielberg should be ashamed and should take notes. APOCALYPTO should be required viewing.
I will make this short and sweet as there are so many reviews of this movie:  "Apocalypto" is a modern work of art and is, perhaps, one of the finest films ever made. Visually stunning, the movie is an emotional and intellectual feast.  I cannot say enough about the care, effort, and quality that went into this masterful production.<br />Mel Gibson has a fine acting career, but this film proves he could well be (with the exception of Peter Jackson) the most gifted director we have today. Thanks to all who worked so hard to make this work of art - simply magnificent.
Wow, an edge-of-your-seat action movie, a quintessential `guy movie' with a lot of emotion to boot!  And all the spectacle and lavish detail that we used to associate with the legendary Cecil B. DeMille!  Very impressive, Mel!<br /><br />As you probably know, the story is set among the Maya Indians of Mexico and central America, just at the time of the arrival of the Spanish following in Columbus's wake.  A peaceful village of hunters is raided by the Maya of the city, who march the villagers away, selling the women as slaves and sacrificing the men to their gods (and leaving the poor children to fend for themselves, one of the more heart-wrenching aspects of the film).  The film's main character is Jaguar Paw, a young man devoted to his father, his very pregnant wife, and his small son.  When the raiders arrive, he manages to hide his wife and son away, but his father is killed before his very eyes, and he is led away with the others to the city, where a priest at the top of an imposing pyramid cuts the men's hearts out, beheads them, and shoves their bodies down the steps, to the delight of the city-dwellers.  Jaguar Paw is just about to go under the knife when a solar eclipse brings the grisly ritual to a halt.  But he is not out of harm's way, as the city warriors decide to use the captives as target practice, most of them being killed in the process.  But Jaguar Paw manages to elude them, taking to the jungle as he hurries home to find his wife and son.<br /><br />For a little over two hours, the movie immerses us in an exotic world.  The people speak Maya, so subtitles are required.  As in his Passion of the Christ, Gibson chooses to open the film with no credits (other than the film company logo), so we are immediately plunged into this strange time and place, where the designers spared no pains in giving us an authentic look at the customs, clothing, and hair styles of these people (including the intricate tattoos, scarring, and body-distorting jewelry).  The Maya city is awesome, with its hundreds of extras caught up joyously in the horrifying ritual slaughter.  (We can imagine DeMille looking down from heaven and saying, "Now THAT is the way to make a movie!")  The violence is painfully graphic--like the Aztecs, the Maya made a spectacle of cutting the hearts out of their victims and holding them aloft, to the great delight of the people.  The heads of victims are displayed on poles, and after Jaguar Paw makes his escape, he has to tread through fields of decomposing bodies.  While much of the scenery is beautiful--the lush jungle, waterfalls, the city--what takes place is gut-wrenching, not only the constant threat of human predators, but also venomous vipers and charging jaguars.  (There is a brief glimpse of an adorable jaguar cub--then cut to its bloodthirsty mother nearby.)<br /><br />And yet, with all the bloodshed and action, this is a movie with heart.  Jaguar Paw is not only a sturdy (and smart) action hero, but an emotional man who loves his father and can't for a moment take his mind off his wife and son (who endure their own agony waiting in their hidey-hole).  He watches as his captors kill one after another of his friends, and in the course of the film his face registers just about every emotion possible.  We want desperately for this man to escape and find some peace with his wife and son (and the unborn one, which is born in one of the most bizarre scenes in the movie, though I won't spoil that for you).<br /><br />I suspect the movie may offend some people, such as PETA members who will object to the opening scene of the village men hunting down a tapir (a piglike jungle beast) or to the warriors killing the mother jaguar.  Also, the movie gives a Politically Incorrect (but historically accurate) view of native Americans, who are assuredly NOT living in peace and harmony together, and who sold each other as slaves and practiced a religion of human sacrifice.  In fact, the movie ends with the sight of Spanish ships on the coast--an event the PC crowd would lament, but then, after watching the natives slaughter each other for 2 hours, we wonder how much worse the Europeans could make things.  (The fact that the Europeans ended the human sacrifices is, let us admit, a good thing.)<br /><br />The actors in the cast are all unknowns (to Americans, anyway), which is good, since we almost feel we are watching a documentary.  Gibson used lots of Mexican locals as extras, and they are refreshingly real in front of the camera.  One standout is a small girl, whose village has been destroyed by the raiders, who utters an eerie prophecy of doom for them.  Something in her eyes unsettles the warriors, who seem to be both superstitious and guilty. It is one of the creepiest scenes in the film, one of many which bring home the reality of the human tool taken by these raiding expeditions.  In another scene, one of the village men about to be sacrificed watches as his old mother-in-law is put on the auction block--no one buys her, so she is simply cast off, nowhere and no one to turn to in a strange place, her daughter dead, her son-in-law about to be killed.  We remember an earlier scene where she appeared to be a thorn in his side and are rather touched as she touches his shoulder as he is being led to death--she and he no longer at odds, but partners in suffering.<br /><br />As I watched this film, I was aware of getting much more emotionally involved in this than in the typical Die Hard or Terminator type of movie, with a high body count.  There is a high body count here also, but we get more of a feel of loss, as the people who are killed and injured aren't just one-dimensional human targets but people whose deaths matter.<br /><br />Way to go, Mel!
I was adviced by a friend to buy this one, and I certainly didn't regret that.  First of all, let me start off by saying that this is really an original movie and idea.  Here we are witnessing a rather smaller group of tribal people that live in the jungle of South America, actually the area in and around Mexico.  It is, so to speak, a protrait of that famous Mayan civilization.  The group lives in and off the jungle, which means that it regularly hunts for food.  While most of the tribes that lived in the jungle are peaceful, this group has the bad luck of meeting with a predatory regimental group that is hell bent on killing all others who live in the jungle, and taking some of them as slaves.<br /><br />The protagonist of this movie, a young man called Jaguar Paw, is among those who become slaves of the predator tribe.  His story shows the tribulation of his captured groups members, until one day when he manages to escape.  What now happens is an incredible man-hunt for Jagaur Paw, especially since in the event of escaping, his killed the son of the commander of the "army" of that violent tribe.  I don't want to reveal too much of the rest of the story, suffice it to say, that it is really realistic, and especially the way that the movie was filmed was simply amazing.<br /><br />By the way, to keep the reallistic atmosphere of the movie in tact, the whole film is done with subtitles, leaving the actors to speak in their native language.  This, I think, was absolutely necessary to keep the authenticity of the film.
I, for some odd reason, didn't expect too much from this picture. I certainly didn't expect it to be this good. But it is.<br /><br />The storyline is fairly simple and is not new in itself (although the setting is new). A capable young chap is caught by some evil men, escapes and has to run for his life (and indeed also for his wife and childs life). However, it is all very well acted, directed, edited and scored. The cinematography is top notch and the actors well cast.<br /><br />I did get a feeling of it being a bit too modern in style though. Both in dialogue and action. Except for the fact that it is acted in ancient surroundings (and the human sacrifices) it's got a very modern feeling to it.<br /><br />In a word, it's one evenings worth of solid entertainment.
First of all, let me say that I had no desire to see this movie.  I thought that it was bloody and graphic and that is not the kind of thing that I am into.  When my husband convinced me to watch it with him, I was awestruck.  Yes, there is a lot of blood and violence, but the characters themselves are more important.  Yes, a few scences caused me to turn my head--but only for a few seconds because I just hand to find out what happended to the characters.  The characters, especially Jaguar Paw and his family, are so compelling that I was brought to tears more than once. Really superb acting, and a nice mix of dramatic, tragedy and humor.  I think, for those of you who appreciated Pan's Labrynth on a dramatic level (and not so much for its fanatsy element) will appreciate this movie also.  Those of you who are sticklers for historical accuracy might be miffed at the cultural mixing (a point my husband picked up on) but I who do not know a lot about these cultures did not catch these inaccuracies. Overall, I think that this is one of the best movies to come out all year.
Mel Gibson continues to be one of the finest directors in the business.  This was a great spectacle and non stop action.  The movie is paced so well that it seems to go quickly even though it's over 2 hours long. Great movie, I highly recommend it to anyone.
Note: Native American with English subtitles.<br /><br />The '06 epic film 'Apocalypto' is a stunning cinematic achievement that is so graphic in its depiction of violence the viewer could easily become overwhelmed by its visceral assault on the senses and miss the more subtle nuances of this well constructed storyline. There are numerous avenues of thought one could pursue in examining this movie such as;<br /><br />1) The exploitation of one culture over another,<br />2) Man's instinct to survive and overcome adversity,<br />3) The power of love,<br />4) The endless cycles of beginnings and endings and<br />5) The prophetic nature of human history that transcends all cultural and religious boundaries.<br /><br />There's much to digest in this film that doesn't immediately present itself on the initial viewing. It's more than a big budget revenge film where the hunted eventually becomes the hunter. Watch it again, you might discover something you missed the first time.
Fascinating, Brutally violent at times, historically plausible (no one knows exactly what happened to the Mayans or to their civilization...hence the mystery that has surrounded them for centuries) yet at times profoundly touching and personal, Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" is, after all is said and done, after all is shown on the screen, a story about one man, Jaguar Paw (a terrific Rudy Youngblood) and his family (wife Seven played by Dalia Hernandez, his son and his father). As "Braveheart" was basically about  William Wallace, so Director Gibson smartly  uses one character as a repository of all his thematic material thereby focusing not diffusing our attention on something  upon which we cannot relate (though, to be truthful and based on Gibson's recent public outburst, you can't help wondering what the subtext here is...i.e. how this relates to our current political and religious situation): i.e. in this case the last days of a crumbling Mayan civilization which, out of desperation has put all its hopes in basically witch doctors who attempt to appeal to the "Gods" via human sacrifice.<br />Jaguar Paw, as one of the many captured by the ruling tribe, is the center of our attention thereby making his plight personal. JP as portrayed by Rudy Youngblood is strong, handsome, brave, intelligent, a loving husband, son and parent. When he is captured and sent to be sacrificed, degraded by his captors, even then his innate goodness and bravery shine through.<br />The Centerpiece of "Apocalypto" is the Temple scene at which the High Priest (a disgustingly smug Fernando Hernandez) spills the blood and removes the entrails of several men (the captured women are sold off like cattle) all in service of the "Gods."<br />Gibson films this scene in what can only be called a frightening, crazy, frantic manner: the beheadings, the Royal family smirking, the thousands of citizens screaming for blood, the heads rolling down from the upper regions of the temple: the camera swirling all around from the frightened faces of the captives soon to be killed to the strange, almost immobile, because of face markings and headgear, grin of the King (a very weird looking Rafael Velez). The scene becomes almost unbearable because of the intensity with which it is staged and filmed...then Gibson pulls away.<br />To me all that is important about Gibson as a director is that he makes good movies. And "Apocalypto," though not up to the level of his "Passion of The Christ" is a very good movie. It's furiously paced, it's beautiful to watch, the acting is first rate and it is infused with the sounds and vistas of an almost mystical and very much mysterious time and place: a place and a time that Gibson brings alive by way of his special and profound magic.
Employing a cast of Yucaten Mayas and some native Indians,using dialogue spoken in Yucatec Maya and a cast of unknowns to emphasise the mythical elements and stripping the story down to an action-chase genre(nonCGI)in a primitive culture,set in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica,Gibson has astounded moviegoers with Apocalypto. Make no mistake this is a powerful film by a craftsman-shaman of the film world.The film is preceded by recalling the opening quote to the film("A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within"),written about the Roman Empire.Gibson is making a parallel point with our own civilization: environmental degradation, excessive consumption and political corruption.The ending is inspired and more hopeful than it seems.<br /><br />This is about one man's quest,Jaguar Paw(Rudy Youngblood),to save that which matters most to him in a world on the brink of destruction.After leading a bucolic existence in the forest Mayan tribespeople are captured by aggressive invaders and bound together,taken to a Mayan city,to be sacrificed to the sungod to invoke fertility. Jaguar Paw has to overcome his fear through an adrenaline-soaked heart-racing dash through the jungle.Violence is endemic to this world-rape,pillage.slaughter,sacrifice-and although it is gory,blood is seen pumping out of a head wound,a man's face ravaged by a jaguar,an arrow going through a man's jaw,a ditch of exposed headless bodies(shades of the Holocaust?),a lot is left to the imagination e.g. when the priest's sacrificial knife goes into the body we don't see it going in or the heart at the moment when it's pulled out. The violence was credible in the story of warring tribes.We see live animals like tapirs and jaguars being killed (but only using dummies).Gibson's real message comesfrom the mouth of the shamanic storyteller about man ravaging the earth.<br /><br />The secret of the Apocalypto's visual appeal is a relentless motion of the story and the hero,camera tracking him and his pursuers in every scene.Semler does the cinematograhy,emphasising speed and fluidity and using long takes.The Mayan houses were exactly like you would expect to see:corn husks,pottery sherds,feathers and textiles, baskets and mats.Many of the architectural details are correct,but cobbled together from different localities and eras.Experts think much of the movie could be set during the 9th century,but by the end it seems to be the 15th century. Also inaccurate,the slaughterhouse of sacrifices is closer to the Tolmec-Aztec cultures. Mr. Gibson's direction is clear and crisp and he knows how to involve an audience, taking them on a breathtaking roller coaster ride chock full of spills and thrills.I was hugely entertained and could not remember enjoying a film as much in recent years. Mr. Gibson is a mesmerizing story teller.This is his mea culpa for obnoxiousness in his public behaviour.
didn't know the dvd could have gotten any better until i watched<br />this blu ray.<br />brighter, sharper, crystal clear video.<br />clearer, booming, rockin' audio. you can hear down to a pin drop,<br />and there weren't any pins in those days.<br />what more is there to say?<br />if you don't have, you should get asap.
There is simply no other film that can be accurately compared to "Apocalypto."  The mere fact that it was brought to film is amazing.  While the film concentrates on a period of time between the flourishment of the Mayans and the infiltration of the Spanish, we know that that period spanned decades, and the film gives us a glimpse of the not-so-untroubled times for the local natives.  While the Mayans were flourishing, the civilization was also hopelessly corrupt in a moral/spiritual sense.  Their regular blood sacrifices of human beings to their gods displays a kind of inner moral bankruptcy -- from which there was no return.  Our view of this "great" civilization is through the eyes of a captive villager, and, along with him, we are aghast at the decadence, the absolute indifference of individual life, the waste, the barbarism.  By mere chance, coincidence or providence, our protagonist is able to escape immediate extinction.  Most of the movie focuses on his adrenalin-filled run through the jungles -- with hopes of returning to his wife and son -- both left in a virtual pit of hopelessness and despair.  The odds seem insurmountable.  Wounded, exhausted, shocked, our protagonist moves ahead -- at first with a pure sense of instinct then with his father's remembrance to feel no fear.  These qualities, along with some very good luck allow him to gain an advantage over his relentless (and scary) adversaries.  Nothing seems predictable here.  Advantages soon turn sour.  It is only the uncanny willpower and perseverance of our protagonist that seems to propel him from capture and death.  All spoken in a native tongue (with subtitles), the viewer is immersed in a point of unspeakable horror, chance and endurance.  This film is unlike any other that I've seen.  It's very, very powerful movie making.  This is the best-directed film by Mel Gibson, and I can only hope that the Hollywood circuit allows him to go forward and explore new, unseen dimensions of the human experience.
It's a shame that this movie did not get the screen time / publicity it deserved all around.  A great movie, one that you can tell was not "hollywood" manufactured with a great ending.
I had previously rented this and liked it enough to buy it once it came out on Blu-Ray. True, it's not for every taste but to my knowledge its historically accurate. Well, pretty much. It looked real, it sounded real and I felt immersed in Mayan history. What cruelty there is is done for "religious" purposes (except for one sociopath who just seems to get a kick out of it..there's one in every crowd.)I like escape/survival situations especially when they are realistic and Apocalypto certainly delivered. So, in my opinion you should give it a try but be warned...heads will roll.
Even with all the controversy surrounding Mel Gibson I still looked forward to seeing "Apocalypto." Why? If for no other reason--the subject matter, subtitles, and lack of star power made it a bold choice for a major studio release. The film was fantastic.  I had to buy this movie.  I love Jaguar Paw.  I hope to someday meet him and tell him that he is a wounderful actor.  I recomend this movie to everyone who enjoys a great movie.  I look forward to seeing Apocalypto part 2.  This movie gets 10 stars from me.  Thanks Mel Gibson for this moving movie made from the heart.<br /><br />Sandra
Being a new time in history to document and present to the public as informative entertainment leaves many avenues of presentation to investigate.  Mr.Gibson's views on possible historical interpretation is fabulously inventive, dramatically overwhelming and probably true. His crativity makes me wonder what his dreams are like.
This movie is fantastic - but, I hope you don't mind reading subtitles! However, once the movie gets going, you don't even notice that you are reading anymore. The movie is a bit graphic, so for you viewers that have a sensitive stomach - I wouldn't recommend it! :-)
I rank this movie up there with The Departed and Gladiator.  Amazing adrenaline rush.  Great plot and good depiction of the demise of the Mayan culture.  This should have atleast been an Oscar contender for best picture of the year.
I have a lot of respect for Mel Gibson's historical story-telling ability.  The depth and detail seems to increase with each film.  However, I find his use of gore and violence to be excessive.  With Apocalypto, again Mel Gibson seems to surpass himself in the creation of this story and the use of incredible detail. Bloodshed has not been excessive which makes for a much more refined picture.  And the ending ... I will not comment on such a beautiful surprise.  This is an excellent, thoughtful, and adventurous piece of art.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A4LVYY">Sony BDP-S350 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player</a><br /><br />Having been a late adopter to the technology of Bluray (I was waiting on the dust to settle between HD and Bluray), I wanted to appreciate the technology with this movie.  The Bluray disc contains how the movie was made, one deleted scene and the movie.  I am surprised that there were no more deleted scenes.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />This is a story of a young hunter and warrior Jaguar Paw in a peaceful tribe.  The initial scene seems more of a locker scene amongst young athletes where they hunt a small tapir and distribute out the parts of the animal.  One of the brothers is teased about his manhood and the others prod him to eat the testicles of the animal.  The scene shifts towards a foreshadowing of terror as a tribe gives an offering to pass through.<br /><br />Set in the indigenous culture, we get a glimpse of the rituals, weapons, and dances of the Mayan people.  The pace of the movie speeds up, as the small village is attacked, and the hero, Jaguar Paw, is taken to a Mayan city where the women captives are sold as slaves and the men are sacrificed on an altar.<br /><br />The second part of the movie takes a breathtaking view of the rainforest in central America, as our hero is chased by his would be assailants, as an act of retribution for the killing of the Mayan Chief's son.<br /><br />THE MAKING OF APOCALYPTO<br /><br />The documentary was well done and gave a lot of insight into the research and efforts made into the costume, dances and special effects.  I also enjoyed how the movie producers went into the challenges of shooting in the rainforest.  The video was also in 1080p with excellent sound.<br /><br />QUALITY<br /><br />The sound and video quality are excellent.  The movie soundtrack is well done.  The costumes are greatly detailed - and in the Blu-ray version, you can see some of the women with their teeth in-laid with Emerald stones.  The movie is entirely in subtitles and I recommend watching the movie first while reading the subtitles.  Then I recommend watching it for the sheer beauty and details that these artists have created.<br /><br />CAUTION<br /><br />The brutality of the movie is intense.  From the initial scene of the killing of the Tapir, to the rape and pillage of the small peaceful village, to the death march, sacrificial scenes, death by Jaguar mauling, and extreme fight scenes - the movie is not for the faint of heart.  Some periods of nudity are also portrayed.<br /><br />VERDICT<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie.  The fights and pursuit scenes are exciting.  The sacrificial scene was as authentic as I could recall from the history books.  This story is not intended as a true historical perspective, but as a showcase of the talents of modern day cinema.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.
BRILLIANT MOVIE BY MEL GIBSON-PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT-AUDIO IS EXCELLENT-I LOVED THE STORY TO THIS FILM-ONE MAN ON A MISSION TO GET BACK TO SAVE HIS FAMILY - AND BEING HUNTED BY A GROUP OF KILLERS AND ONE OF THE BEST ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT MOVIES OF ALL TIME-10/10
Best movie with an actual story that I have enjoyed in many years. It is a bit violent, but the story is built around the violence of one group of people towards another. Having to read subtitles was no problem as I was so into the story and what was going on I hardly knew I was reading the lines. The actors were so good you knew what was going on even when there was no script. Yes a great movie......
Apocalypto (Mel Gibson, 2006)<br /><br />So many reviews of this film I've read, both amateur and professional, dwell on the violence. I don't know what other movies these folks are watching. The Passion of the Christ, for one obvious comparison that's just as mainstream, was far, far more violent than this was. There are movies less than half this long that are far more violent. I think the bottom line as far as this goes is that if you have a weak stomach, you might want to avoid Apocalypto, but if you had no problem with The Passion of the Christ (or, honestly, Eastern Promises), then don't let all the shock over the "extreme" amount of violence in this movie get to you. If you want to see it, the violence won't bother you.<br /><br />In any case, the story: Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a warrior and hunter in a small rural tribe. Everything's going along swimmingly until a Mayan slaver band attacks and captures almost the entire tribe. Jaguar Paw is able to send his wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and son off to hide in a hole, but the slavers find out about it and cut the vine she's supposed to use to climb out. Thus, Jaguar Paw has to find a way to escape before he's sacrificed and rescue his wife and son before they starve, or die of thirst.<br /><br />Not a bad little revenge thriller, this, and Gibson, as he did with The Passion of the Christ, adds the mystique of a foreign setting and a language far removed from that most people are familiar with. As a gimmick, I'm sure it will grow old eventually, but Gibson is a proven director on ground he's very familiar with. As a result, the film is very effective. The cinematography is gorgeous, unsurprising as Gibson once again pairs with Dean Semler (Dead Calm, The Road Warrior, Razorback), one of those fantastic cinematographers they grow down in Australia. The make-up jobs are gorgeous, and the action sequences are choreographed in such a way that you'd never think they were choreographed. This is good stuff. Gibson turns in another winner; when he's behind the camera, it seems, he can't lose. *** 
This has to be one of Mel Gibson's finest films (as director). The Mayan characters are well-portrayed (there's a very good balance between good and evil, and that's something that's not regularly seen in other films). The art direction and cinematography are excellent (it's unfortunate that they didn't win during the Oscars). The music is hauntingly beautiful, and the main chase sequence in the second half of the movie revs up the tension oh so high. Blood and violence are excessive, so parents are warned.<br /><br />A-
Great for the visual quality, the rich settings and costumes, the use of native actors,locations, fabrics, dyes, and language...not too "Hollywoody". Truly a cinematographic feast.<br /><br />Compare to Cecil B. DeMille's (sp?) work. Not much of this grand pageantry anymore.<br /><br />The extra scenes about the making of the film were excellent. I didn't see most of the details they mentioned, until I looked back at the actors again. It was that realistic, so that even the "wild" fashions of the era seemed natural on the people.<br /><br />It was great to get a better idea of Mayan - and also Aztek - life. I think the Olmecs were similar, too. Each bloody dynasty in its age.<br /><br />But it can be hard to visualize the times and the people just from Discovery Channel specials, or flaking wall paintings. Mel did us all a service, in his inimitable "12-expresso" emotional style.<br /><br />Whatever you think of him personally - and we *don't* know him personally, apart from media bites that are *designed* for controversy,<br />not the Gospel Truth --<br />Mel is a GREAT writer/director/producer. Worthy of study by aspiring writers/film-makers.<br /><br />I can't say I loved this film, like so many reviewers have. I didn't, as far as the story line went, because I don't like Mel's graphic depictions of human pain and bloody injuries. I hate films about human cruelty, and oppression - but that was how it was.<br /><br />"Entertaining", well, not really in a fun sense. It was a gripping, tension-rollercoaster of a movie. As a good film ought to, it pulled me into the experience of the characters.<br /><br />Life is often painful and ugly, not "politically correct", so these are things that "hook" a wide audience. We may feel revulsion, but on some level we relate. I see many viewers felt entertained in a good way - and I will consider that in crafting my own writing.<br /><br />I would almost call this a horror film. "Historical horror" fits.<br /><br />Go see it, leave the kids out of it, and learn about Mayan culture.<br /><br />Become more thankful for our relatively safe and easy life. Work for social justice - the Maya are not the only abusers out there - and as the village elder said "don't let the fear get into you".<br /><br />It is possible to draw parallels between Mayan behavior and corporate culture. And socially - are we so different? We let the weak/old/unproductive members die of emotional neglect/abuse in satitized conditions,instead of admitting they aren't wanted - and giving them a quick slice of an obsidian blade? "Civilization" seems relative.<br /><br />Hmmm. I see deep discussion material.
Wow, what a movie!<br />This rates as one of my all time favourite movies.<br />Original, very different, a gripping tale of epic proportions that had me riveted to the screen from start to finish.<br />An explosion of culture, family, fun, sadness, pain, anger, violence and heart stopping suspense that left me wanting more.<br />I hope there is a sequel for what I think is a brilliant movie, a movie that deserves far more recognition than what it has received, simply stunning!
Blu-ray has to be the best thing that has happened to me. I bought the movie in blu-ray and it was fabulous viewing. To start with, i love the movie and more so, the landscape, scenes are so real and so fabulous, it is like watching through my window. A must see movie and a must see in Blu-ray.
This is a very good movie.<br />Some people might complain that Mel Gibson's graphic use of violence, reminiscent of the Passion of Christ, is excessive but somehow with him, unlike Tarrantino for example, it just doesn't seem to be for the sake of it. The execution scenes in the Mayan capital are very gruesome and probably historically inaccurate but they enhance the movie and bring home just how savage human nature can be beneath the surface, in any culture and at any time.<br />That was also the core message of Conrad's Heart of Darkness and I wondered when I watched this film if Gibson's choice of title "Apocalypto" and Coppola's "Apocalypse Now", based on The Heart of Darkness, was coincidental.<br />And that's the irony of the ending. The arrival of the Conquistadors will bring about a greater genocide than anything the viewer has just seen, and all under the banner of the cross and Western Civilisation.<br />This movie makes the viewer think, as well as shocking him. Worth Watching.
If ever there was a great movie of courage, strength and the belief of a higher power; where fear is not an option,this is it!  I've watched this movie at least 6 times already! Pretty graphic, but what an awesome movie!  Blue Ray is the only way to truly appreciate this movie!
The actor who played Jaguar Paw was a beautiful young man. With his lovely wife Seven and their young son they formed a very attractive proto-nuclear family. (The little boy was awesome. How do they get kids that young to act that well?)<br /><br />The urban Mayan temple episode was fascinating and horrifying. I'm not sure how much research went into it, but the gradual approximation to the altar as the sacrifices were happening and the crowds were exulting made my gut fall into my bowels. That was probably the plan. It worked. Give me some of that old time religion, Mel.<br /><br />And there was quite a bit of it in Apocalypto. Terrifying urban corporate sacrifice. Private pleas to gods and ancestors. Horrible and beautiful. Miracles? Natural events? Pretty much like religion today.<br /><br />There are so many heartbreaking scenes in this film: Flint Sky's goodbye to his son. Blunted - the sweet strongman with reproductive issues - and his wife as she's dragged off to suffer rape and death and he, bound, can only watch and curse. The captive mother's prayer at the river crossing for the children who can't follow and will now be alone. "Gentle Ixchel. Tender mother of mercy. . ." Blunted's later wordless reconciliation with his mother in law. (I really liked the Blunted character.)<br /><br />Happily there was a bit of the formula "good guy opens up a can of whoopass on the baddies" to make a regular Joe like me happy. And the cinematography was lush, like the jungles in which the movie took place.
I believe that the source of this movie's controversy is derived from the fact that many do not like Mel Gibson.  I'm not a fan of Mel Gibson and his recent antics, but this film is not about Mel Gibson.<br /><br />It is, rather, a historical film about the Mayan civilization.  There are historical inaccuracies, sure, but a lot of historical movie epics are historically inaccurate- Titanic, the Patriot, and just about every historical Disney animation, for example.  If ALL historical movies were unrelentingly accurate, many of our beloved films would be complete borefests.  Let's take this movie for what it is- a great action film, which happens to take place within a Mayan context.  This is Hollywood...who says that every movie has to be a source of social enlightenment or revelation?  I loved this movie, and I am NOT a "bloodthirsty fool" as many of the one-star reviews believe to be the only people who will enjoy this movie; I am an academic.  Certainly do not watch it if you are faint of heart.  However, if you are not afraid of exploring the "dark side" of mankind for two hours, then you are in for a great edge-of-your-seat adventure.  I do not believe that the movie's ultimate message is that Mayans were barbaric, uncivilized and in dire need of some Christian guidance.  That is, in my opinion, a superficial interpretation.  It is not about good Christian, bad Mayan.  Rather, the movie explores the extremes to which human beings will go to explain and appease their sources of hardship and/or suffering, and how deep one's will is to save one's own life and that of his or her family.  I think that the film successfully gets this point across.  If you can look past the blood and gore (which I believe enhances the context of the film), then this is certainly an evident feature of the film.  I know it is especially hard to look past the historical inaccuracies, but I really thought that the film was brilliantly filmed and written.  I hope that some of the bad reviews are not reviewing this movie based on biases of Mel Gibson- he's a jerk, I know- but if you haven't seen the movie, please don't avoid it because of Gibson.  It is really worth watching to decide for yourself what you think of it, not what you think of him.
Mel Gibson's 2006 film Apocalypto contains all the essential elements of the typical epic drama: over 2 hours of nonstop action where an unassuming hero, the young family man Jaguar Paw, played excellently by Rudy Youngblood, finds himself in a vicarious situation where his home and hearth are threatened and he is forced to venture out from what he knows in order to protect and defend what he holds dear.<br /><br />As a Mayan warrior living at the time of the conquistador arrival in the New World, Jaguar Paw is familiar with the ways of the Yucatan jungle where he and his ancestors have lived comfortably for generations.  The audience first sees him with his fellow hunters and shares in the easy fellowship that exists in the village.  We admire the loving relationship that identifies him as a father and husband, but most of all it is that Rousseau-ian wild child, hanging-around-without any-clothes-in-the-forest innocence that we covet.  Jaguar Paw seems to have it all; that is until another Mayan contingency plunders through his village, kills the undesirables and transports JP with other potential slaves and human sacrifices to the Temple of the feathered-snake god, Kukulcan, in the central Mayan metroplex of Chichen Itza.<br /><br />Gibson films with amazing authenticity - his depiction of the internal and external suffering of JP and his village counterparts creates gut-wrenching moments of the sort he is famous for in Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ.  We not only feel the pain, we live through the exhilaration generated when Gibson utilizes the universal power of myth where the hero travels within a mythical woods fraught with peril leading to an emotionally and physically transcendental initiation that allows him to not only combat the forces of evil, but return to his loved ones fully transformed.<br /><br />Is Gibson merely reenacting the mythical hero's journey or is he simply employing a powerful story to underline a contemporary message?  Apparently he feels strongly enough about whatever the significance is to finance both JP's and JC's (The Passion of the Christ) metamorphosis with personal funds.  However, facilitating graphically painful violence, torture and almost horror movie techniques, he, at times, over illustrates his point.  Beneath all the gore, what is he depicting---man's penchant for inhumanity or his own seemingly insatiable desire to photograph it? Is he using the blood spectacle to mesmerize and entertain the crowd not unlike the emperors of Rome used the battles to the death in the coliseum?  Or does he, like some ancient shaman believe that something purifying and spiritual is born from the mythic "the-king-must-die" blood sacrifice?  Like the front piece to the film, historian Will Durant's quotation, "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within," and the actual depiction of the debauched sickness ensuing from the lower levels of the Mayan society to the garish strangeness of the upper classes, Gibson firstly drives home the idea that as a particular society evolves it becomes jaded by its own sophistication.  What is, at one time, new and exciting, degenerates into old and boring necessitating the exploration of newer and better thrills to achieve a sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />Gibson's heroes differ from the usual Campbell heroes of a thousand faces that need the quest to mature and redefine their values. Their morality and goodness stands firm and in terms of development they remain the same from start to finish.  From the vantage point of the audience, pandemonium reigns --- the sights and sounds of the debauched society evokes that alien quality George Lukas used so well in Star Wars when Luke Skywalker infiltrates the cosmic bar and innocence personified encounters an assortment of cynical alien rou&eacute;s.  We sense peace only in the major characters.  Yes, they are terrorized by the ordeal they are about to undergo, but spiritually they remain steadfast.  Instead, they are the only characters that by their stability and quiet resolve fill the hole carved out by the heart of darkness.<br /><br />Each of Gibson's major characters undergoes his trial by fire by understanding fully that his objective has little to do with the actual ordeal and all to do with their sense of self and their responsibility to their family and home. The cultures he depicts have degraded into abysses of the spiritual where the accumulation of wealth naturally erodes be they ancient Rome in the time of Christ (Passion of the Christ), the British subjection of Scotland (Braveheart) and now in Apocalypto the Mayan Empire around the time when the old world collided with the new.  Those who can still be saved need some kind of mythic sacrificial figure that personifies the values of hearth and home.<br /><br />So, okay, Mel, I get it . . . we all are accidental participants in a corrupt society---desensitized by our own complexity, in dire need of a sacrificial lamb to reconnect us with the all important simple things that life unfolds and ultimately death and the after-life reveals.<br /><br />Bottom line? Mel Gibson's Apocalypto may provide a colorful and raucous panoramic view of a long gone civilization, but it also exemplifies the epic tale of Jungian archetypes where trial by fire transforms and drives the representative hero to extraordinary action.  Bloody in parts, it typifies that which Mel has become famous:  providing a sacrificial lamb that elevates hope and common good for the masses.

Apocalypto was a surprisingly decent film, and this blu-ray is a reference quality/demo material class production.  Video and audio are great, some of the best I've seen on blu-ray so far.  Definitely pick this one up if you like this movie at all.  Doesn't hurt either that the wife of the main character is a real cutie.
Apocalypto: Excellent movie! Brilliant cast, good story; I will watch this again!<br /><br />** NOT for the squeamish ** = a must watch for lovers of gore!<br /><br />Story: "peaceful" forest dwelling villagers have their happy idyllic lives shattered by &lt;EVIL> Aztecs. The hero, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), is dragged away from wife & child. Hauled onto the top of pyramid, just as he is to get the chop/disembowment &lt;&lt;SURPISE>> the sun eclipses and he has the opportunity to escape. Chased by a horde of angry Aztecs, he eradicates them in grizzly and ingenious fashion.... the story builds the baddies as the meanest nastiest guys in South America, so PLENTY of entertainment value (and cheering) when they get it.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw gets to save wife Seven (Dalia Hern&aacute;ndez), family and jungle culture in just over 2 hrs. ***** 5 STARS<br /><br />Gibson also stated that Apocalypto would help dismiss the notion that "history only began with Europeans" source: wikipedia.
As this movie begins to unfold you are aware you are watching a very unique film, first it's the fact it's told in ancient Mayan, second it's that it's shot on location in the jungles of central america.  Let me be frank, the film is brutally violent and as is de rigure for Gibson films the  is up close and personal, Gibson seems to love graphic  and savagry, but it actually works in this film.  The story is simple, but engrossing and you really find yourself rooting for the protagonist as he races against the clock.  The acting is actually quite good and the direction and cinemaphotograpy first rate.  I highly recommend it, its a very good piece of filmmaking, but it is hella violent.
