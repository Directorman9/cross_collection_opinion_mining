Eastwood was outstanding in this movie. It is an intriguing story of 2 people so different that their friendship almost seems impossible. But the softening of a hard heart happens and that is the promise of this movie. It is not a gun shooting typical Eastwood movie but a story of love and hope. I really liked this movie and highly recommend it.
Gran Torino is NOT the typical  Dirty Harry Movie . This is another version of Dirty Harry .<br /><br />Walt ( clint Easwood ) is a Korean War Vet . He is retired . All he wants in his life is sit on his porch , drink beer  , smoke  his dog and he doesn't want anyone on his lawn .One of his favorite dialog " get off my Lawn" . He doesn't want to mess around or mingle with people. He hates the new generation . One incident changes his life "Gran Torino" .<br /><br />Every one is behind his classic car 1972 made Gran Torino. Gran Torino is one reason , he gets close to next door Asian neighbors. Then the movie goes on with all the emotions , relationship up's and down .<br /><br />Good Points about the movie<br /><br />1. This movie has Drama , Comedy , Action ( not much of action )<br /><br />2. Clint Eastwood dialogs in the movie relate to the Dirty Harry version like  "I will blow a hole in your face and then sleep like a baby .<br /><br />3. This movie is named Gran Torino as everybody who comes in his life wants the Gran Torino . Because of Gran Torino , he made new friends from next door neighbors.<br /><br />4. This is about a guy you don't want to mess with . this reminds me of Dirty Harry version. '<br /><br />5. In this movie , Clint Eastwood has grown old and the world has changed for him . the movie shows how a old man ( retired war vet) tries to adjust in today's world .<br /><br />6. Brilliant performance by Clint Eastwood. Terrific Characterization . This should be considered as one of the classic movies of Clint Eastwood .<br /><br />7.

Even when there are no action sequence in the movie. Great Actor .<br /><br />9 . Favorite dialog : Get off my Lawn<br /><br />A MUST SEE MOVIE  BY CLINT EASTWOOD.
Unlike many of the Dirty Harry films this one is poinant and real.  The character Eastwood portrays as a former auto worker was very much like my grandfather.  His values are tested when someone attempts to finish his new neighbors.  I have to reccomend this one because we get to see a sensitivity that Eastwood ever revealed to his viewers in a long time. If your expecting Dirty Harry, look out, it's far different than I'd ever thought it'd be.  An excellent contender for an Oscar. If you can buy this one.  You'll want to watch it more than once.
Clint Eastwood has never been better.  His talent as an actor and director is obvious in this well done movie about racism, the impact of gangs on people, and the challenges that immigants face.
The movie takes You in right away to the point where You are ready & willing to do what You can to help Clint  bring the end to the proper conclusion.
Not at all what I expected, MUCH better.  A Great Clint Eastwood movie.  We will watch it many times over.
I enjoyed this film a lot. Clint Eastwood does a great job as both actor and director, and the story challenges to viewer - it's not regular Clint fare, but it is both entertaining and moving. The approach to an old man winding down his life, and a young man entering manhood works fantastically. Strong stuff, well worth a view.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a>
I wasn't expecting to like this movie and was pleasantly surprised.  Clint Eastwood is pretty much what you would expect in this - a racist, grumpy old coot.  There are some surprisingly funny moments throughout the movie and I cracked up at the scene where the neighbors brought gifts to Walt's door.  Not exactly what you'd call a heartwarming movie, but very compelling and highly recommended.
"Gran Torino" is actor/director Clint Eastwood's best film, hands down.  The way he coordinates the demands of his increasing age with the remarkably bitter and yet deeply decent character, Walt Kowalski, reflects a man rigorously dedicated not only to his art but to making sense of the ruthless, ultra macho image that has been created around him since "Dirty Harry".<br /><br />Walt Kowalski is an embittered Korean veteran who lives in a bad area of Detroit with the Humungs, a group of Koreans who fought with the United States in Vietnam and relocated to various economically impoverished areas.  Walt liberally uses the terms gook, spook, dragon people, and an assorted list of racial epithets that fire off so easily one can't help be amused by them.  He's a man of a different generation and is not a "value racist": this is how he has emerged from warfare and 1950's Americana.<br /><br />Walt is in some ways like a ghost.  The values he cherishes--extreme masculinity, tribal patriotism, family, and even the proper way to approach the tabernacle in the Catholic Church--seem to be disappearing before his eyes.  His faith is also questionable at the beginning of the film. After his wife's funeral, he tells a young priest that he has no desire whatsoever to confess to an "overeducated 27 year virgin who holds the hands of old women and promises them eternal life."<br /><br />His Korean neighbors reciprocate his feelings of animosity.  There are parts of this fim that are drop dead funny because political correctness is dropped entirely.  Walt is not unlike the racist grandparents some of us have had, and if we have, we immediately feel a mix of repugnance and adoration for his absolute certitude in all situations.  Including putting an M-1 to the head of a gangster who steps on his lawn.<br /><br />Thao, a young Korean who lives near Walt, is pressured by his cousin to join the local gang.  After mistakenly trying to fit in with the gang and steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino, which he built himself,<br />they see him as a punk but still insist he try another criminal act to be initiated into the gang.<br /><br />The rest of the film is a meditation on mortality, self sacrifice, and what it means to love another group of people regardless of race, ethnicity, or anything.  The ending, though sad, is also beautiful.<br /><br />One of the top ten films of 2008.
Walt is a foul-mouthed, bigotted, ex-autoworker, veteran of the Korean war. The movie starts with his wife's funeral. The funeral brings in Walt's estrangement with his family and grandchildren. Walt bemoans that his neighborhood is becoming non-white. What the movie does well is portraying how Walt is brought into a relationship with the Hmong family next door. The movies exposes the bigotry of Walt, but what Walt respects most is character. The kid next door is a doormat, but he show compassion for his neighbor. Tau's sister, is spunky and brave, and Walt learns to respect and like her. Walt gets pulled into their community because they need him and in turn he needs them. Food plays a key role in this movie like it does in most communities.<br /><br />All the acting is superb. The movie is deadly serious, but there are some really funny scenes in the movie. Walt's relationship with his barber is hilarious. The relationship with the old lady next door is funny as well.<br /><br />The continuing dialog between Walt and the persistent priest is very good. Walt dislikes the priest at first, but Walt starts to admire him for his intelligence and compassion.<br /><br />This movie confronts bigotry far better than "Crash" and without all the heavy moralizing and coincidences. This movie gives its characters actual personalities and intelligence not just cariacatures.<br /><br />Clint looks old in the movie, but he creates a very memorable character. The movie has very limited special effects, no flashbacks, and limited conversation. The movie centers mostly on Walt with very few side trips. The movie really works with the sparse direction.
A great movie about the quality of your character. The focus is on who you are, not what you have. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I particularly enjoyed the relationship development of Eastwood and the Hmong neighbors paralleled against the relationship deterioration between Eastwood and his "family". The connection vs. disconnection element was surprisingly moving. A great movie. Thanks Clint!
What a good movie.  You just watch and really get into it.  Highly recommend it.  The language is rough but somehow fitting.  The bits of comedy are gems.
I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan, but even if you're not, Gran Torino is a very good movie. It has an excellent plot, great acting, and a realistic though bittersweet ending. It is an action movie, but also touching in that it explores growing old, changes in society, honor, standing up to the "bad guys", and overcoming prejudice (from all sides). This movie has a lot of cursing, but it is in context with the gang culture and times, and some of the violence may bother some, although it has no more than most R-rated action movies out there, and once again, it is in context to the plot. At times it is funny, at times disturbing, and at times touching, but it remains true to the context of the plot. Great movie!
Clint Eastwood lives up to his persona as a tough guy in this movie.  He plays an ageing man in a changing neighborhood.  He challenges not only the gangsters, but also the establishment.  The movie is somewhat predictable but immensely enjoyable, with an unexpected ending.
I won't bother with another run-down of this film's plot, I just wanted to add my nod of approval. Although the story poignantly portrays the clash of old America versus the new America, it is also a timeless tale of redemption, courage, sacrifice and humanity. Somewhat cliched at times, but overall much more thoughtful and touching (and funny) than I expected. As has been noted, the film is incredibly "politically incorrect" but alas, real life often is. 4.5 stars.<br /><br />PS- This film actually made me quite emotional. The ending was very sad but at the same time uplifting. I'm not a religious person, but the story brought to mind the words of the world's most famous philosopher:<br /><br />"There is no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends."<br /><br />Amen
One of the best Clint Eastwood movies in my opinion.  A wonderful story that captures you from the start.  My sister who isn't a Clint Eastwood fan and thought the movie was about cars ended up loving it.
I loved this movie, my husband loved this movie --everyone I know loved this movie.<br /><br />Why?? Such a great story where you actually get to feel what the chacters are feeling --raw emotion. The main character, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood), has just buried his wife. He lives alone, a retired Ford factory worker for some 50 years. A lapsed Catholic who despises the church, and a Veteran of the Korean War, he is a bitter man.<br /><br />Walt hates the way his neighborhood has been taken over by African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians. His new neighbours are Hmongs, mountain people from Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. Walt unwillingly becomes the mentor of a young Asian teenager who lives next door. Walt rejects any act of kindness shown by his sons, and then and later is rejected by them in turn. Walt is all for justice, and when the shy boy he has been mentoring, and his sister are attacked, Walt is determined to even the score.<br /><br />A well preserved 1972 Gran Torino in Walt's garage is his prized, but there is much much more to this story, and lessons to be learned by all.<br /><br />DON"T MISS 79 year old Clint Eastwood, at his finest!
If you did not get this film then you probably would have been sitting at Walt's funeral on the same side as his biological family. To have liked it you might be found sitting with his adopted family and friends.<br /><br />Walt's character represents how I feel about popular society. And for an Australian it helps me also that I've lived in Michigan and even visited the area where this movie was shot.
Would have to be one of the best films Clint has done. As always a fantastic performance.
Simply put, it was a wonderful movie. Had a great plot. The car itself explained a number of references in the movie, however, that's not what it's about. It had enough twists to keep people really entertained, more of a serious movie about our current social/economic views.
This is a movie of redemption. Well...perhaps not in the way you think. This is supposedly Eastwood's last movie as far as acting, or so I've heard. He plays a retired auto worker who's bitter at the world a.k.a. Hollywood's latest attempt at portraying the Grumpy Old Man, but this time it's nothing to laugh at. Here you have a man who fought in Korea, and is prejudiced against all Asians. He for the most part doesn't have anything nice to say about anyone. This all changes one night when his prized possession a 1972 Gran Torino is almost stolen by a teenage Asian boy as a initiation to join a gang. Well it backfires, and the boy is almost killed by Walt(Eastwood's character). It's at this point that Walt's and the boy Tao's paths cross as Tao's family makes him go over to apologize to Walt, and offers Tao to help out Walt. Walt's heart is softened somewhat, and he becomes friendly with Tao's family, and breaks bread with them. He also protects them well the big sister as the gangs in Detroit where Walt lives take a shine to her....Not. Anyway Walt takes Tao under his wing(In his own way), and helps him to come out of his shell. Then the real test comes when Tao's sister is assaulted, and Walt takes matters into his own hands so to speak. Surprisingly he does it up as a way to pay back the Asians he murdered in war while in Korea. He goes out, and gets a fitted suit, makes amendments to his will, and does something his dead wife wanted him to do, and that was to make confession of all his sins. He confronts the teenage Asians with the assumption to kill them all, but imagine that he allows the gang to kill him. This is redemption in action which is how I guess some men try to make amends for not showing love to one another because of male pride, and so forth. Tao in fact gets the closest to an apology from Walt as Tao assumes that he's going along with Walt to confront the gang, and Walt tells Tao that he (Walt) has blood on his hands, and that he doesn't want that for Tao. Not to mention that to the surprise of his family...especially his eldest granddaughter that the Gran Torino goes to Tao. This was a decent outing for Eastwood, but not quite the classics of "Play Misty For Me", or "Heartbreak Ridge". This movie did speak to me however as the scene where Tao goes into the barber shop with Walt, and Walt starts spewing slurs left and right, and then Tao trying to emulate Walt does the same thing, but ends up insulting the guy. This is where we as men have to be careful because we as children want to be modeled after our fathers. I know that one time I heard my father slur a race, and when I said something similar I was told to:"Shut Up." I still don't understand if he didn't want me to utter the slur then why did he do it in front of me? This is not a movie for those who are offended by racial slurs, and downright raunchy language. However, Eastwood should've recieved the Best Actor award for his portrayal of Walt.
I saw a review earlier that mentioned the movie "Crash," which was a terribly overrated film. "Crash" does not compare to the brilliance of Clint Eastwood's "Gran Torino." This movie teaches a wonderful lesson and does so beautifully.<br /><br />Being Eastwood's last starring role in a film, he did a magnificent job at creating a believable character.<br /><br />I could go into more details about the film, but this is one that everyone should see for themselves. Words will not do it justice.
Clint Eastwoods' post production period on "Changeling" (2008) is when he apparently found the time to craft "Gran Torino". Only an institution as archaic and delusional as the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences could neglect this work of art during awards season, and like "Changeling", this too was shut out in all major categories (and sadly, even from the minor categories). What this says about the members' cinematic tastes one can only speculate upon, but chances are they haven't properly understood the depth and brilliance contained within this concise motion picture.<br /><br />As one reviewer aptly stated, this film is not about the car (1972 was a good year for Ford), but the car does come to represent the very essence of the lead character. He plays a mean-spirited old man who is racist, conservative, rude and anti-social, but at the heart of it he seems to be the very opposite of all these things. The film casts him as the sole white resident of an increasingly ethnically diverse lower-income neighborhood, and his attitudes (as vintage as his car) seem to reflect a dying America that seems unable to cope with the diversity brought about by immigration.<br /><br />The film also pays homage to the Hmong people, a true group of Eastern people who were displaced early on, and who have found pockets of solace within America. Even within Eastern societies, this particular group of people have been looked upon as overly conservative and traditional, a fact that the film lovingly pays tribute to, without hitting you over the head with it. Many mainstream publications seem to indicate that this film is about tackling racism and overcoming color lines. Well, that is but part of it, and in many ways not even. Race becomes a very secondary issue here, and by the end of the film you find yourself unable to find the issue relevant at all.<br /><br />Ultimately, the story is about a widower who finds he has no purpose in life, but he also has a difficult past, having been in the military at one point. There are thousands of such veterans all over the world, and this could be their story. Whats incredible is that even though most of our lives are far removed from the lead characters', you will find yourself empathizing with the character, and his racist attitudes seem almost humorous (it also seems that he is less racist than he is territorial).<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is not a thriller or a fast-paced action film as its' misleading cover might indicate. Hardly. There are a few scenes of violence and one unnerving segment featuring a female lead (a great acting job by Eastwood here), but other than that, this is largely dialog driven. Its' most affecting segments come when Eastwood tries to integrate with his Eastern neighbors - largely humorous, but you'll find yourself relating to these scenes in ways you hadn't imagined. The standout performance is by the young lad who plays Thao, who plays the second lead - its an innocent, camera-friendly performance that relies more on fortitude than actual acting, but he does a commendable job.<br /><br />This is also clearly not a film for everybody. Some may find it heavy-handed and unbelievable, but the end of the film is so moving and apt, that it should get to the most jaded viewer. Prime bits of trivia also litter the films sets, and more educated audiences will have fun trying to pick up on them. For the record, this also marks the debut of Clint Eastwoods' youngest child, a 21 year old actor. Try to find out where he features - its one of the standouts of the entire film for many reasons.<br /><br />Four and a Half Stars. A beautiful work of cinema, and testament to the fact that Clint gets better with age.
If, as I've heard rumored, Gran Torino turns out to mark Clint Eastwood's final film role, he'll at least have gone out with another memorable performance to add to his long list.  Portraying the unlikely friendship that develops between a disaffected 70-something Korean War vet and the son and daughter of a Hmong family that lives next door, the movie is a surprisingly affecting and at times even funny story of personal redemption and cultural collision.  With a backdrop of urban decay and gang violence, it also makes for an interesting portrait of the continuing decline of the American city, even if its ultimate focus is more personal.  Much like The Wrestler, another of the past year's best films, Gran Torino provides a look at the kind of people and areas many of us don't see in our daily lives, let alone in movies, and portrays its characters sympathetically without neglecting their flaws.<br /><br />The film is largely carried by Eastwood, whose well-established tough-guy identity gets a new twist in the form of Walt Kowalski, a retired Ford worker who stubbornly clings to his house and his old-school ways in a Detroit neighborhood that's rapidly being taken over by immigrants and a larger world that no longer seems to be his own.  In a way, Walt represents the flip side of Eastwood's iconic characters and persona: he's The Man With No Name turned into a dinosaur, Dirty Harry rendered irrelevant by changing times.  We first see Walt snarling his way through his beloved wife's funeral, angered by the various signs of modernity he sees around him and the lack of respect shown by his descendents.  As the movie goes on we get a better idea of the reaons for Walt's anger: his sons have grown into suburban yuppies with overprivileged brats for children, and his middle-class neighborhood has come to be dominated by minorities, especially Hmong immigrants whom he describes using a variety of disparaging epithets.  This is clearly a guy who's not too familiar with the concept of political correctness and who feels no need to discard the prejudices he's taken for granted his whole adult life.<br /><br />It would be easy, especially at first, to dismiss Walt as a simple crank and bigot, and while that description wouldn't necessarily be inaccurate it wouldn't tell the whole story either.  In his own way, Walt is an idealist, one who believes in certain values--patriotism, self-sacrifice, hard work, proper lawn care--that he believes (rightly or not) aren't shared by his new neighbors.  As we see through a series of conversations with the well-meaning local priest, Walt has fallen victim in his old age to a combination of cynicism, alienation, and racial hatred, born of his harrowing experiences in Korea and a mounting disgruntlement at a world that's relentlessly changing around him.  The film does do a pretty good job (largely through Walt's growled declarations to himself) of allowing the viewer to see the world through the eyes of an aging man who's surrounded by the unfamiliar and having a hard time adjusting to it.  Charged at age 78 with largely carrying the film, Eastwood has the difficult task of turning Walt from a caricature to fully fleshed-out character over the course of two hours, a feat that few others could pull off but that's helped immensely by his natural gravity and his own gritty, stark direction.<br /><br />While Walt may seem like a giant ball of hate at first, he does eventually start to warm up to his teenaged Hmong neighbor Sue (Ahney Her) and later to her brother Thao (Bee Vang), even after Thao tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation.  The bond that gradually emerges between Walt and Thao may be unlikely at first based on Walt's obvious hostility toward other races, but it eventually comes to seem perfectly natural because they're both committed to maintaining their integrity in a world that doesn't seem to have much room for it.  Thao is trying to make his own way in an immigrant society of limited horizons, with few options for the future beyond taking a menial job or joining his cousin's gang, when Walt sees enough potential in him to try to help him overcome the limitations of his surroundings.  Vang has to turn Thao into a real, conflicted person rather than just an idealized symbol of his people, and while he's not as good as Eastwood he still does an admirable job of keeping up with his legendary costar.  Scenes of Walt developing a comfort level with his Hmong neighbors carry an almost sociological fascination, along with the irony of a cranky old racist getting absorbed into the world of Asian immigrants while his relationships with his own family become increasingly strained.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of a few flaws, Gran Torino manages to be a largely excellent movie.  The opening scenes of Walt expressing his seemingly all-consuming bitterness and hatred can get a bit tiresome, and the ending is a little over-the-top and dramatic compared to what preceded it, but there's still more than enough quality material to make this film worth watching.  The slower, more contemplative middle section is actually the most interesting part of the movie, as we see the challenges faced by both the aging Walt and the coming-of-age Thao in their daily lives, as well as the slow, awkward process of Walt letting his guard down enough to become a mentor to Thao.  Those looking for a change of pace from the never-ending stream of remakes and TV and comic-book adaptations coming out of Hollywood could certainly do a lot worse.
Another entertaining movie by Clint Eastwood. He was great as the  opinionated, grumpy old man with old school ideas that didn't put up with other people's bull. While his own children and grandchildren were ready to send him to a retirement home and wait for their inheritance,the family next door found value in him other than just monetary and as a result an unexpected friendship. Entertaining from start to finish.
GRAN TORINO<br /><br />***** Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- December 12th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 116-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- Nick Schenk<br /><br />Director- Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Starring- Clint Eastwood, Bee Vang, Ahney Her, Christopher Carley<br /><br />2008 was a great year in the legendary career of Clint Eastwood as he delivered two of the best films of his career with Changeling and Gran Torino; both of these movies were two of the very best of 2008 and I fail to understand how neither of these movies received a best picture nomination or best director. If Gran Torino is Eastwood's last acting gig he sure as hell went out with a bang with what just might be the best performance of his career.<br /><br />Gran Torino is vintage Eastwood he's made a career playing the tough guy and he is the last of the ultimate film tough guys with Bronson and McQueen no longer with us. Even in his late 70s Clint can still pull the tough guy role off to perfection; Think of Clint's character as maybe an older Dirty Harry in terms of the tough guy persona. Again even at his age you never doubt that he's still the ultimate tough guy. And again this is vintage Eastwood.<br /><br />Gran Torino gets off to a solid start, but there isn't anything that really stands out, but as the movie goes on it simply gets better and better and by the end of the movie I was blown away by how amazing of a movie this was and it had me in awe. Gran Torino is an instant classic and one of the best movies in Clint Eastwood's career both as an actor and as a director.<br /><br />The screenplay by Nick Schenk was slightly clich&eacute;d in some spots, but overall it worked well with some truly great characters that are also very well developed, which is something rare these days in Hollywood. Gran Torino may not have the perfect screenplay, but it's a very good one. The dramatic scenes play out well and there is also some comedy and both these elements really work very well. Like I said the characters are fleshed out and developed and all the main characters will get a reaction from the viewer. So even if Gran Torino is slightly clich&eacute;d in spots, Nick Schenk makes up for it with some truly great characters.<br /><br />As director Clint Eastwood knocks it out of the park with a truly gripping and touching movie. At first I wasn't really a big fan of Eastwood's direction. I never felt he was a poor director well outside of maybe The Rookie, which was a bit poor. But I never felt he was a bad director, but I never really got into his direction. But over the years I have found a new appreciation for Eastwood as a director and he's by far one of my favorite directors now. What makes Eastwood such a great filmmaker is his simplicity, which can sometimes bring a filmmaker down, but Clint doesn't try and be flashy and simply tells the story.<br /><br />Gran Torino again was truly gripping and touching; Eastwood hits all the right spots in terms of drama and comedy and really brings you into this world and makes you care for the characters. The action sequences are brief, but all pack a punch and aren't overdone, but done in a simple way that makes them all the more powerful. It seems like the Academy always nominates Eastwood every chance they get, but why he was snubbed for Gran Torino and Changeling is beyond me. Gran Torino is everything it's been made out to be and more. As filmmakers get older normally they don't get better. But Clint is just as great now as he ever was and maybe in some ways better.<br /><br />About the only real flaw one can find with Gran Torino is possibly the acting. While none of the performances are terrible, but some are a bit wooden. Clint Eastwood is a great actor, but he doesn't have a lot of range. He pretty much plays a variation of the same character for the most part and by no means is that an insult. Eastwood is possibly the best at the role he plays. Outside of Bronson and McQueen nobody can play the tough guy like Eastwood and I'd say he's a better actor than Bronson, but sorry I'd have to give McQueen the edge. But while Clint may not have the most range he's still a fantastic actor, but here with Gran Torino his performance was mind blowing. In terms of acting I think Unforgiven and Gran Torino were his two best as far as range goes. As Walt Kowalski, Eastwood is funny, sympathetic and very likeable. Eastwood shows a great deal of range and I truly believe an Oscar nomination should have come his way.<br /><br />Making their film debuts are Bee Vang as Thao and Ahney Her as Sue and both actors show some potential. Bee Vang does well and while his performance is by no means perfect and a little rough around the edges in some spots, but he handles it well and his character was likeable. Again it was his film debut so you cannot expect perfection, but overall he does well even if a little stiff at times, but since the character was likeable I'll give him the passing grade. Ahney Her however steals the show with a really great and energetic performance and what she has going for her is charisma. Each scene Ahney was in she really lit up the screen and brought a lot of fun to the character.<br /><br />Gran Torino was no doubt one of the best movies of 2008 and Eastwood's performance is one of the best if not the best of his career. Despite some clich&eacute;s Gran Torino works on every level and is a must see for all Eastwood fans.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release for Gran Torino was simply just ok; the picture quality is excellent and no complaints there; the sound was alright, but nothing really special. The features though are quite weak the Blu-ray has an exclusive feature about the making of the movie, which was pretty cool, but such a great movie and such a poor release just isn't right.
Clint can you make a bad movie? This movie is great. The character's transition, humor, awesome acting, and a great story. Couldn't ask for much more. If you are an Eastwood fan, this is a keeper.
This movie rocks! I wasn't sure that it would be, but within the first five minutes, I was hooked! Clint Eastwood really knows how to draw you in at the first scene. This movie shows all that is good about people who are no-nonsense, get-to-the-point, and believe that being politically correct is crap. Eastwood plays this part brilliantly when he portrays Walt Kowalski, an old Korean War veteran who is greatly misunderstood and taken for granted by his family. He eventually befriends an Asian boy named Tao and mentors him on the finer points in being a man. He also looks out for Tao's sister Su and their family that live next door to him. Kowalski stands up against gangs that hang frequently in the neighborhood, and grows very close to Tao and his family. He sees the differences in his family and Tao's and sees the shallow and fake concern of his own family contrasted with the warm, inviting comraderie of Tao's family. Granted, there is a lot of swearing and some violence in this movie, so would not be appropriate for children. However, it seems to fit into this type of movie. Yay to Clint Eastwood-he's done it again!!! Very refreshing to see a character like his play someone who calls it like he sees it w/o political correctness that is shoved down our throats nowadays. Just watch it, you'll LOVE it!
Clint, back in form, playing a familiar but new dark hero who is older, grouchier and less PC than Superman and Green Lantern. BD great but mild, very mild especially audio. First Warner BD that defaults to DDTrueHD at the start, that I've seen. I like it.
I believe you have to be in a certain mood to enjoy most movies. That said, you should be ready for a dramatic movie with some humor and a little suspense.
Clint Eastwood has become an icon, not just for his iconic film roles over the very long career he has had, but also for his outstanding directing. Ironically enough, the movies where he is the director AND main actor, are the ones that shine the most. (Example. "Pale Rider" and "Unforgiven")<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is expertly directed and acted by Eastwood and brings that classic touch that only he can do. His character, "Walt", is not likeable at all in the beginning and many may feel that way even through the end. He is an angry man, mad at the world and all of the problems the world has caused him. He is a veteran of the Korean war--a war the U.S. lost. He is a recent widower and his two sons and their families have little to do with him unless they need something. His neighborhood is deteriorating around him. He is a racist, pure and simple, non-apologetic about it.<br /><br />With all of that said, you might wonder if there is anything redeeming about the character of "Walt" or the movie. A resounding, yes. The movie traces "Walt" as he goes from being that grumpy old man in the neighborhood who doesn't want to have a thing to do with his neighbors, particularly the Asian ones living next door, to being the same grumpy old man, but mellowing out as he befriends the Asian teenager and his sister next door.<br /><br />While his own family doesn't need him and views him somewhat as a burden or annoyance, the Asian family next door needs him to help with getting an Asian gang from leaving them alone. "Walt" sees a young teenager who has potential and knows that he needs to help him out with some tough love and being like a big brother. The scenes are classic and enduring. The chemistry between Eastwood and the actors who portray brother and sister is spot on.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie is good and you are never bored. I was always excited as to see what would happen next and Eastwood didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Many might find the movie as not politically correct and I think that is a good thing. Political correctness has its place, I guess, but in movies, I don't see a reason. Eastwood's character was shaped by a hard life and war and he doesn't mince words and tells it like it is. It is one of his best acting performances by far in recent years.<br /><br />Overall, "Gran Torino" is fine Hollywood filmmaking at its best. You will thoroughly enjoy this movie and yes the title is a reference to Eastwood's character's car which has underlying significance to the story.<br /><br />4/5 stars
A brooding Eastwood just wants to be left alone. He is truly living in the past and quite content with it. His compassion for an ethnic minority neighbor overcomes his self imposed isolation and his Dirty Harry character emerges. My favorite line is when he is confronted by the gangbangers and slowly explains to them that there are some people that they should just not #%*@ with! A must for any Eastwood collection!
As far back as I can remmember going to a Clint Eastwood film has always in itself represented a warranty for watching something decent at the very least. After UNFORGIVEN came out, there were plenty of just OK films like SPACE COWBOYS, ABSOLUTE POWER, TRUE CRIME and the like but recent years have come with an Eastwood streak of fantastic hits which is just amazing considering the guy will be 80 next year. My personal favorite will always be the said UNFORGIVEN but GRAN TORINO is definetely in my top 5 favorite Eastwoods. The sight of the boy driving the car by the lake at the very end should have you smiling from ear to ear. Just great.
This film resonated with me for several reasons.  First, because<br />I am a 3rd Generation Japanese-American and visibly recognizable as<br />an 'Asian', with the resultant consequences in American society.<br />Secondly, because the film was shot in the greater Detroit area and<br />I was born and raised in Detroit.  Finally, because I have been BOTH characters shown in the film.  I was the clueless, withdrawn and shy Asian teenager and<br />after retiring from the Detroit PD after 25 years of street patrol service, I<br />have become the grumpy, conservative old man.<br />I see some of the reviewers who gave the film only 1 or 2 stars, have missed the point of the film completely and for entirely opposite reasons. I saw the words, 'depressing, 'dark', and 'sad' used by some of those reviewers.<br />Welcome to the life of an Asian in America.<br />The young Asian guy in the film may have appeared 'wooden' but he was a fairly accurate depiction of what I was like at that age.  And no, I was never gang-raped by any group of racist cowards. The racial antipathy of some of the negative reviewers towards Asians, is pretty transparent to me.<br />Some people will never confront nor admit their own level of racism toward all Asian people.  Hollywood has contributed greatly to decades of depicting us as the traditional enemy of White civilization.  So it is good that a Hollywood film has done something significant to counter-balance that propaganda.  The film 'Letters From Iwo Jima' was another contribution Mr. Eastwood has made toward better understanding of the other guy's point of view.  Perhaps Mr. Eastwood's marriage to a woman with a percentage of Japanese ancestry has made him more acutely aware of the insane degree of racist antipathy toward all Asians, which is held by millions of folks in this great country?  When I recommended viewing of 'Letters' to some of my friends, who are WWII buffs, to my surprise, they refused to even watch the film, because anti Japanese sentiment is still so pervasive, that they have no interest in even considering the perspective of these former enemies.  Discovering that about my 'friends' was an eye-opener for me.<br />Now I want to close this review by stating the 'real' reason why Gran Torino was snubbed at the Oscars.  It had nothing to do with the racial slurs made against Asians.  It was in fact because there were no black characters in the film with any socially-redeeming qualities and the only ones shown were despicable street gang members, who were addressed by Waly Kowalski with racist slurs comparable to those he used when addressing the Asians in the film.  Here's where the big double-standard comes in.  It is acceptable to laugh about the Gook, slant, slope, Dragon-lady insults, but the Academy wouldn't DARE endorse any film which contains any anti-black language or messages. That is sacrosanct, Holy ground, upon which no public media is allowed to tread.<br />There are minorities in the USA and then there are Untouchable Minorities.<br />Tell me I'm wrong.
This movie, Gran Torino, completely held my attention for the entire time it played.  This is Clint Eastwood at his best, both acting and directing.  It seemed as though the movie was going to be predictable when it started and in some ways it was, but there were enough twists and turns in the plot that the way it ended was not what I expected.  His character, Walt's, Detroit neighborhood is changing along with the world and he isn't.  I winced at some of the politically incorrect humor and remarks that came out of his mouth, but felt a sadness for him, being all alone in the world after his wife's death an his sons being emotionally distant and involved in their own lives.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Walt was portrayed as a strong man in spite of his age and his points of view.  He is a likable character even though at the beginning of the movie none of the main characters like each other.  As the movie goes on you begin to see a building of respect and understanding among them.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that I'll think about and remember for a long time.  There is a lesson to be learned here.  Two thumbs up!
Clint Eastwood did it again. Another fine effort from the man that has given excitement in many of his movies. This times he tackles life in a neighborhood that has changed with new immigrants.During the movie you find his relationship with his family is rocky and his wife's priest interesting at times. It also features moments that Eastwood is known for...his stand for what is right against being double crossed and for standing up for friends. One of his lines in "Gran Torino" is "I'm not a hero"...to me Eastwood is a hero of good cinema fare! I enjoyed G.T.!
This film, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is nothing short of a delightful gift to those of us who have loved Clint Eastwood through the years.  Here, he plays the role of a nasty old Korean War veteran who thinks like it's still the 1950s and is angry all the time.  His wife has just died, his two sons don't respect him and his granddaughter wears a belly ring and wants his vintage 1972 Gran Torino car which he, himself, assembled when he worked in a Ford plant many years before.  Also, a young-fresh faced Catholic priest keeps hounding him to go to confession.<br /><br />Clint lives alone in a neighborhood that is fast becoming multicultural and he hates his Hmong neighbors which he refers to as "gooks."  But things change when he catches the teenager, Thao, from next door trying to steal his prized automobile.  The teen's sister, Sue, convinces Clint to let the boy work off his debt and soon a begrudging respect seems to soften Clint a little as he see how hard the boy works.<br /><br />The neighborhood is rife with gang warfare and drive-by shootings are common.  So is the constant recruitment of the gangs for new members and the Hmong gang wants Thao.  Clint starts to train Thao for a job in the construction industry so that he doesn't have to join the gang and this leads to some of the funniest scenes in the film as he tries to teach Thao to "act like a man" and throw ethnic insults at everyone.  Thao becomes his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and Clint becomes friendly with the Hmong family, especially when the women keep bringing him food.<br /><br />Soon, though there is a crisis and Clint, who we soon discover is probably dying, must prove himself as a hero.  I knew he would do something but was surprised at the complexity of the conclusion, which made the film work as a whole and ended in an extremely satisfying way.<br /><br />I loved this film.  I laughed out loud at times and also felt real emotion as Clint grows to accept the present world in which he lives and winds up emerging a hero.  I have nothing but accolades for this production although I know that some might cringe at the racist insults and find it a little too violent.  But that's what a Clint Eastwood film is about.
I was shocked that the Academy virtually ignored this fine film and heaped praise upon the over-rated "Slumdog Millionaire" when this film explores the important issues of assimiliation and gang violence as well as "Slumdog" did but with so much more power.  If Eastwood is implying that this is "farewell" movie than he couldn't choose better one to sign off on.  Yet as one reviewer stated you could nit-pick that neighborhood Clint's character lives in is basically Africain American but doesn't deflate what the movie is about.  Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is probably one of the most complex and ambiguous character that he has ever played.  No wonder that the National Board of Review voted him "Best Actor of the Year"----and this is from a nation-wide survey of critics across the country.  Like another perennial Oscar best actor loser, Peter O'Toole, Clint may just have to accept a "Achievement Award" from the Academy. Anyway, shame on you Academy--it's really about politics and not about quality since how can an Italian comedian (Roberto Benigi) win for the atrocious "Life is Beautiful" (probably thanks to the Weinstein's constant promotion).
I love this film and ,when seeing it in the theater, it was nothing like I expected and everything I hoped for.  The 5 stars go to an incredibly moving, dramatic and humorous film that should have won an Academy award for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best everything.  That said, there are plenty of reviews here already doing a book report on the plot so I will refrain from that.<br /><br />So lets take a look at the Blu Ray version and how it stacks up to the Standard version which I also own. The Standard DVD version was not bad to begin with.  The Blu Ray video transfer is good, not great.  There is a scene early in the film when a car pulls up and you can clearly see aliasing/stairstepping in the cars chrome grill.  Seeing this, I look for those artifacts in other areas of the video transfer but failed to find them.  As this is a dark film, somewhat  desaturated in color, the shadows retain depth and detail as a blu ray transfer should, but, then again, so did the standard def version.  The Audio is DDHD and, as this is a very dialogue driven film, there was little use for the surround speakers or sub. There was some use of the front side channels when cars were driven but that was about it.<br /><br />The extras were the typical commentaries, and an interesting and informative 'making of' with a good amount of discussion regarding integrating the Hmong culture and actors within the film.  This was well worth watching.  Really don't see the big deal about BD Live...does anyone really use it?  I would have rather space been used for deleted scenes, of which there were none, out takes and the like.  You were able to see some original audition clips for the parts of Sue and Thao and I would have liked more of this.<br /><br />I buy movies on Blu Ray for a serious upgrade of both video and audio.  While this movie gets 5 stars because it is a great film, for those who have the standard def version, I do not believe that you will see a significant difference between it and the blu ray version.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thanks.
I simply have to admit that some of the scenes in this movie had me cracking up big time.<br />When Eastwood's kids recommend that he go into a nursing home, the look on his face is nothing short of hysterical.<br />If you're sensitive about race you may want to skip this movie because pretty much everyone get's unloaded on in this movie.<br />An entertaining look at human relations in America.<br />Maybe not the most realistic.<br />I don't think I've met anyone as hostile as the people in this movie.<br />Amazing acting.<br />Excellent direction.<br />Pacing, score, pretty much everything was perfect.<br />A touching but very blunt movie.<br />I recommend it, it's an eye opener.
This drama, starring Clint Eastwood, and directed, produced, and partially written by him, is properly advertised as "the performance of a lifetime." It is undoubtedly one of the best films. The story is about an elderly man, an award winning veteran of the Korean War, an atheist, who has never been found contentment in life, whose wife just died, and who, knowing her husband's problems, asks a young parish priest to look after him. He lives in a neighborhood that has changed, surrounded by Orientals who he calls gooks, whom he doesn't understand and dislikes intensely. He is very possessive of what he has and wants to be left alone. He becomes involved with his neighbors when they are attacked by a gang. Everything about the film is great, the story, plot development, acting, pacing, suspense, scenery.<br /><br /> Viewers can be stimulated to ask lots of questions about the many issues raised in the film. These include: the problems of growing old, death of a spouse, illness among the aged, getting along with children, grandchildren, and neighbors, handling neighborhood gangs, prejudice, bad and belittling language, finding meaning in life, the existence of life after death, the impact of wars and killing, revenge, are clergy equipped to address problems they never faced. Most significantly is the issue of change: can an irascible discontented elderly man, who has no ability to interact with his own family, find meaning and love from strangers?
GRAN TORINO was directed by Mr. Clint Eastwood and it stars Mr. Eastwood. The story was by Dave Johannson and Nick Schenk.  The movie lives and breathes humanity. The movie is almost like a melange of CRASH (2004) starring Matt Dillon, ALL IN THE FAMILY (1971-1979) starring Caroll O'Conner, and MEN OF HONOR (2000) starring Cuba Gooding. On one or two occasions, GRAN TORINO shows the grittiness of THE PAWNBROKER starring Rod Steiger.  Throughout the film, there are near-continual undercurrents of tension, where one might expect an outburst of some sort to occur.  There are no weak periods in this film.  There is no filler in this film.<br /><br />Here are a few comments:<br /><br />(A)  MEDIATING BETWEEN TWO CULTURES.  Ahney Her, who plays Mr.Eastwood's neighbor, will steal your heart.  She serves as a go-between, mediating communication between the traditional American culture and the traditional Hmong culture.  She is fluent in the Hmong language, and fluent in English, and she has no trace of accent when she speaks English.  The film becomes ever the more powerful, towards the end, when she become a tragic figure.  The Hmong language actually consists of a group of dialects, spoken by Hmong people of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, northern Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos.<br /><br />(B)  WHAT MATTERS MOST IN LIFE.  The film identifies what is the meaning of life.  For some people, the essence of the meaning of life is to discover the cure for cancer.  This goal is reachable by only a select few, such as Prof.D.Slamon, the inventor of trastuzumab.  But for others, such as the character played by Mr.Eastwood, meaning of life comes from teaching somebody self-respect, and teaching somebody a new skill.  Perhaps, that is what GRAN TORINO is all about.<br /><br />(C)  SELF-SACRIFICE.  Regarding the ending of the film, this film takes exactly the same approach as that taken in Mr.Eastwood's other movie, SPACE COWBOYS.  The approach is this.  A man who knows he is terminally ill sacrifices himself to do a good deed.  This approach is emphasized by a crack in the sidewalk, in a scene at the end of GRAN TORINO.  The use of this symbolic crack is a work of pure genius. (I'm not telling you what it is. There is no need for a "spoiler alert" at this point.)<br /><br />(D) CIGARETTE LIGHTER.  This is about the cigarette lighter bearing an insignia.  GRAN TORINO has the recurring theme of a cigarette lighter bearing an insignia.  This exact theme occurs in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  In STRANGER ON A TRAIN, the lighter has a picture of golf clubs, a symbol dear to the heart of the protagonist.  In GRAN TORINO, the lighter had a symbol of a U.S. military group from the Korean war, a symbol dear to the heart of the protagonist. My understanding is that STRANGER ON A TRAIN is frequently used as a teaching device in film school.  Hence, the use of this particular theme in GRAN TORINO cannot be said to be a coincidence.  There is nothing wrong with recycling themes.  In fact, when themes are recycled, this enables contemporary cinematographers to stand on the shoulders of earlier cinematographic giants (to paraphrase Isaac Newton).<br /><br />(E) CATHOLICISM.  GRAN TORINO is a fine educational device for those interested in knowing what is Catholicism.  For those totally naive in matters relating to Christianity, and to Catholicism in particular, this movie seems to provide a practical, fair-minded, and favorable accounting of this religion.  In contrast, it is the case that many other Hollywood productions characterize Catholicism as a cult that is obsessed with witch hunting and exorcism, or as a religion for simpletons (as in, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, starring Helen Hunt as the Catholic).<br /><br />(F)  STAR WARS CANTINA SCENE.  GRAN TORINO never lets up with its continual entourage of clever scenes.  When Mr.Eastwood eventually goes to the clinic, he finds himself in a waiting room filled with foreigners.  There is an Indian woman.  There is an East Asian man.  The receptionist is Ethiopian Moslem woman.  When the receptionist calls out, "Mister Kowalski," her accent is so strong, one can almost feel Mr.Eastwood cringing because of how poorly his name is being pronounced.  By the time this scene arrives, the viewer of GRAN TORINO is already aware that the qualities of Mr.Eastwood's neighborhood that were known to him, from the happy years 1950 to 1980, have simply disintegrated into nothingness.  To avoid dropping into the hole of existential nothingness, Mr.Eastwood clings to the few remaining things that he can, almost obsessively so.  These include Mr.Eastwood's unending parade of Pabst beer, his Italian barber friend, and the rituals of mowing his lawn and polishing his GRAN TORINO.  Anyway, the scene at the waiting room in the doctor's office, with its bizarre melange of different nationalities, reminded me of the STAR WARS cantina scene in located in the city of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine.<br /><br />(G)  NAMES.  Naming is a concept normally studied by Ph.D. students in philosphy, psychology, and literature.  Thousands of college professors have carved out their career by studying the symbolism of names, that is, names of characters in books and plays.  This particular movie contains the interesting theme of names.  Towards the beginning of GRAN TORINO, Clint Eastwood complains when the priest calls him "Walt," and demands that he be called, "Mr. Kowalski."  Eventually, Mr.Eastwood softens, and reluctantly allows the priest to call him, "Walt."  At about the same time, Ahney Her, the charming Hmong teenager, calls him, "Wally."  Mr.Eastwood raises a protest, but it is modest, and he finds himself feeling comfortable when Ahney Her calls him, "Wally."  An explanation is at hand.  What does the priest have to offer Mr.Eastwood?  Nothing.  And what does Ahney Her have to offer Mr.Eastwood?  Plenty -- her family provides him with tasks that provide meaning to his life, including, making humble household repairs, teaching Ahney's brother how to talk like a confident man, teaching Ahney's brother a trade (carpentry), and protecting Ahney from neighborhood gangs.  Then, towards the end of the movie, the issue of names comes up again in the clinic, where the Ethiopian reception mangles Mr.Eastwood's name to the point where it is almost unrecognizable.  She calls, "Mister Kwaaski?  Mister Kwaaski?"<br /><br />(H)  AIRHEAD.  This is about actor Dreama Walker.  Ms. Dreama Walker is a professional actor who has been in dozens of films.  She plays the airhead.  Her character is simultaneously charming and nauseating.  Dreama Walker's character fits squarely in the tradition established by Alicia Silverstone in CLUELESS and by Moon Unit Zappa in her song, VALLEY GIRL.  The airhead seems to be a new literary invention, as I am not sure if any character of this type has ever appeared, for example, in the works of Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Moliere, or Shakespeare.<br /><br />No review can do justice to the intelligence, insight, humor, and humanity, that is found in GRAN TORINO.  While this film certainly does not provide insight regarding EVERY aspect of the human condition, it does provide a compelling narrative regarding relations between young versus old, American versus foreign, naive versus savvy, and so on.  As a comment on the "human condition," I find this film is as remarkable as any piece of literature coming from the pen of Shakespeare, Dostoyevski, or Melville.  But a difference between GRAN TORINO and the works of Shakespeare, Dostoyevski, and Melville, is that you do not need a Ph.D. in literature to understand GRAN TORINO.  Five trillion stars for this one.
This is a movie about a retired Marine who gets a little lost and finds his way home. A man who served his country, his family and his community. I've known a few like the main character and Eastwood does an excellent job portraying him. He reminded me of my Uncle Jack. Hero (Medals and all), WWII and Korea. I saw the show in the theater and decided I wanted a copy to save. It's a great guy flick.
Clint Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, not Dirty Harry even though the promo for the theatrical release makes you think it's going to be a guns-blazing Dirty Harry encore. His role is more like the tough gunny from Heartbreak Ridge who is now a senior citizen.<br /><br />Okay, guns and fisticuffs are involved, but the film is so much more than that. Joining Mr. Eastwood in the film is Christopher Carley as Father Janovich, a determined priest who knows little of real life as lived by Korean war vet Kowalski; Ahney Her, entrancing as Sue Lor, the spirited Hmong girl next door who just won't let Kowalski continue living isolated and alone; and Bee Vang as Thao Vang Lor, called Toad by Kowalski who becomes his surrogate father and role model, teaching the young Hmong how American blue collar guys bond and behave.<br /><br />As the film opens, Kowalksi is in church for the funeral of his wife, a woman he characterizes later as the best woman in the country that he managed to catch. You won't catch Kowalksi moving into assisted living though his stereotypical sons would love to sell the family home in the old neighborhood and put him where they could justifiably say, "He's being taken care of." He's an embarrassment and an emotional anvil around their necks just as they are a puzzle to him.<br /><br />The trouble with the old neighborhood isn't that it's been taken over by Asians, but that the gangs - Asian, black, Hispanic - have a stranglehold on the decent people who are trying to find their piece of the American dream while still clinging to their traditions and values.<br /><br />Gran Torino isn't so much about knocking heads, defending the old neighborhood, and facing down gangbangers as it is about character growth and discovering that family doesn't necessarily mean the people you're related to by blood. Eastwood gives a layered performance that is worthy of Best Actor. In fact, there are several stellar performances in this film i.e. Carley's priest and unknown actors Ahney Her and Thao Vang Lor. Even Clint's son Scott Eastwood, credited in the film as Scott Reeves, is good in his role as the gutless Trey.<br /><br />The ending is surprising. And poignant. If you're an Eastwood fan, you'll love the film. If you abhor Eastwood, you'll be surprised how this film stays with you. I'm just surprised Eastwood didn't sweep all the major film awards. Awards don't make a film a classic. Make no mistake, Gran Torino will become a classic.
Clint Eastwood really does act well.  His character begins as a frustrated and negative Korean War Veteran/Retired Auto Worker who is hateful of his Asian neighbors. But as the movie progresses, he softened by his neighbors love and generosity.  By the end of of this film, Clint becomes quite fond of his Asian neighbors and makes a great sacrifice to eliminate a violent gang.  I enjoyed this film very much and so will you.
I know people say that this film is inspirational, made them cry, etc. I'm not saying that's false - but I am saying that until you understand the main character his language is initially a little shocking. There's also some pretty disturbing implied violence near the end. But don't let any of that stop you from seeing this movie.<br /><br />Oscar winners tend to look like the same film in the best film category, but this movie trumps the typical Oscar winner in genre, performance and just good written truth novelist style. Eastwood mumbles quite a bit, and his presence swings from humorous to downright intimidating in just seconds. The movie successfully changes your opinion of every character, and in a VERY rare Hollywood moment includes a sympathetic priest character. I can't tell you how many directors are scared to include THAT. For that, and many other reasons, Gran Torino is a bold film, and worthy of your evening.
As somebody who likes things simple and sweet it is with no surprise that I just love this movie. Clint Eastwood's style of directing just gives you the necessary. There are no 'fast cuts' just for the purposes of creating tension or action. He just lets the actors and story do there jobs. Eastwood's performance as an actor is one of his best. As a director he manages to get many of his supporting actors, many of whom had never acted before, to give credible performances that don't diminish what he wants to convey.
Wow, this was a great flick with a cool ending that I didn't see coming.  This movie had a lot of heart.  Age appropriate for Clint, but with nuts of steel.  A perfect vehicle.
I don't know why but I am so happy Clint Eastwood has been acting in, directing, editing etc. movies that humanize asian people.  Being half asian and seeing this movie and Letters from Iwo Jima I'm really liking what Clint is doing.  Aside from the humanizing asians in america, this movie was brilliant.  Thank you Clint.  You rock!  You always have.
Order was placed close to the holiday with no guarantee that it would arrive by December 24.  I fully understood this.  To my surprise, it was received rather quickly and was able to be included with other holiday gifts under the tree.  Since this is a favorite movie of the recipient, I was especially grateful.  The service exceeded all expectations.
This was a very good movie with a great message on how young men need older men to mentor them
Ha ha, okay maybe a little elaboration... I'm not a fan of his dirty cowboy days but his recent movies are definitely Oscar worthy! (and I don't even watch the Oscars =P) I'm sure this has won something somewhere but I'm just sayin... It's THAT GOOD!
Clint Eastwood is brilliant as the racist, redneck widower who has no connection with his children or their children. His interaction with his "Gook" neighbours are heart-warming and funny at the same time. His confrontation with the baby-faced "virgin" priest is another highlight.<br />Recommended
Clint Eastwood does a great job in his role as a widowed Vietnam War veteran whose neighborhood is becoming predominantly Asian. Great film, some funny parts, the plot is complete but eventually depressing, and the ending is great. Lots of racial terms and swearing, but this is a Vietnam vet we're talking about.
Clint Eastwood proves he still has it.  Loved the movie to point that watched 2 times already and got both my sons the movie for Christmas as knew they would love it.  He is the best!!!
This is a little known movie that is highly underrated.  I recently purchased it on Blu-ray from Amazon because it was on sale and had some great reviews by others.  I had never seen it in theatres and never even knew about it until I read some of the reviews.  It is a really powerful movie which gets to the heart of things quickly.  Right from the start you realize that Eastwood is playing a tortured man who needs help but somehow can't take it from anyone.  Eventually he comes around and makes his point. Definatley not a film for the younger crowd.  Lots of foul language and cursing as well as racial slurs.
Clint does an amazing job of being funny and insulting all the same time in this saga of a grumpy old guy who turns out to be an exceptional human being. I love all the insults he hurls at his neighbors and how he takes his revenge on the bad guys. Very Eastwood indeed. This movie is my favorite of all his movies and I don't know why. It just gets to me. The title song he wrote plays at the end credits and it's one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I cry every time I hear it. Clint is extraordinary in this flick and you just have to see it and you'll agree. It's a gem! -R. Lodato
The Gran Torino, as a car, is a vivid symbol of a glorious past when the blue collar worker was economically well off and America, especially industrial towns like Detroit were prosperous. Clintwood shoots the film in Detroit in contemporary US with the auto industry down on its knees and where new immigrants have moved into the homes earlier owned by white Americans like Kowalski. Whatever the change in demographics, the basic problems of crime or gang warfare and territorial passions remain unchanged. The ethnicity may have changed, but the human condition has not. We see the slow evolution of Kowalski from a being an unabashed racist to a 'humanist' if I may use the word in context. With Clint Eastwood, violence remains as a constant -- something that does not change but has to be handled. And Kowalski is portrayed as a Korean war veteran whose been there and done that. Death is something that he has experienced first hand and I liked the poignant moment when he tells the priest that he knows very little of death. In fact, the hard life that he has experienced has brought a sense of irreverance to faith and religion. In fact in his stage of life, when the majority in his age group would gravitate towards religion, the opposite happens to Kowalski and it this is extremely well portrayed by Clint Eastwood. He would rather sort out the dilemmas of life himself than rely on a youngster just out of a seminary. To my mind, through this portrayal Eastwood is making a statement about religion and the intermediaries between man and God, who may not have the experience and judgment to advise as they do and about organized religion of all forms. In a completely stunning, well planned, meticulously thought out move, Eastwood uses death as a surprise. His meticulous and langorous planning for the grand finale (including the winding up of his affairs, leaving the dog at his neighbours and making peace with the priest, if not the almighty) and leaving the Gran Torino not to his grand daughter but to his new friends, not only speaks about what goes on in the community, but his own personal transformation as a human being and preparation for the final journey, when all worldly confusion has come to an end. I have watched all the movies that Clint Eastwood has made over the years. This one is outstanding, with the same kind of subtle acting that we saw in Bridges of Maddison County or A Million Dollar Baby. Arguably, this is his best as an actor. It is a complex piece of movie making made simple through that art of great story telling and a very sure and mature thought process. This is good old wine to be savoured and enjoyed.
This is a great movie to watch. Once again Clint Eastwood did a great job with his acting and producing skills. This is a must see movie. It has a sad ending for Walt (Clint Eastwood). He played a grumpy older Korean war veteran in this movie. Sandy
Redemption is a continuing theme in Eastwood's movies, all the way back to the wonderful spaghetti westerns. His character usually is conflicted, imperfect, and scarred, yet wants to do good, and to be good.  Gran Torino is a wonderfully polished yet fresh variation on the theme of redemption. I hope I will have done something in my life that is worthy of the kind of admiration I have for this movie.
After all these years Clint Eastwood can still deliver an excellent performance!! This movie will touch you heart!! If it doesn't you don't have one!!!
No surprise.  A classic Eastwood movie with all his nuances.  By the end of the movie you are drawn in and care about all the people involved. Great job.
Clint Eastwood proves yet again that he is the best living director. I really enjoyed this movie. Clint Eastwood's fans won't be disapointed...neither will movie lovers. This is a home run.
this is clint eastwoods final movie and it is a very good movie.  I would recommend it to anyone.
I always loved Clint Eastwood as actor, but once he started directing I understood the true power of this man.  So when "Gran Torino" came out, I knew I will have to see it.  This film is a work of genious on so many levels. It is setup in the working class Detroit that inevitably like most cities, keeps changing.  Eastwood's characted Walt Kowalski is no so keen and eager on adjusting.  It is the death of his wife and her funeral that break heart watching this growling man come to terms that the term "dysfunctional family" has a whole new meaning for his own.<br /><br />Alone, retired and left to his own devices, Walt is forced to accept his Hmong neighbours who in turn take care of him in their own way.  How can a man so full of bitterness, prejudices and contempt for the world around him adjust to this arrangment?  Well, you have to see the movie because it will break your heart.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is building his own legacy that will remain a legend on its own.  This is one of the best movies I have seen lately.
Gran Torino, a Clint Eastwood movie, has a simple easy to follow plot.  Eastwood plays a character that is struggling with life around him passing him by.  His life used to be more predictable, Now he struggles with the changing culture around him, to the point that he sticks out like a sore thumb.  But while the movie has a simple plot line, it certainly doesn't have a simple message.  In fact, Eastwood takes on some of the hardest hitting themes in our society today with such ease, I can't imagine another director or actor doing a better job.<br /><br />The movie is nothing short of amazing, and definitely describes the lost generation between the "greatest" and the "baby boomer".  His open hostility towards other races is not hidden, yet through the movie he embraces the very culture he says he hates.  The ending took me completly by surprise, and for me took the whole movie from a 4 star to a 5 star, and made my list of the most defining movies of this decade.<br /><br />The language is very raw so be aware.
Clint as everyone knows is a great talent in both acting and directing. And here he does both, giving a fine performance as Walt Kowalski, a war veteran and retired Ford worker living in Detroit. We pick up Kowalski's story at the funeral of his long time wife. As an unemotional type he will grieve in his own quiet way. We learn at the wake that he has a strained relationship with his 2 grown sons and their families. They have moved on to the greener pastures of the suburbs while Walt stays in his old decaying urban neighborhood. The movie makes the most of the on location filming in Detroit. The dying city is filmed with great effect. You see Clint's character moving through very troubled neighborhoods with vacant storefronts, crime, rundown and abandoned homes. It is sad and unfortunate that this is a true portrayal of Detroit.<br /><br />As someone born and raised in Detroit everything is dead on in it's portrayal of this slowly dying city. I saw a parallel with my own upbringing as I also lived in a neighborhood that changed from predominatly white. My Father had many of the same racist notions that Kowalski has here. And Kowalski has no problem slamming just about every ethnic or racial group- Jews, Asians, Blacks, Latinos, Italians etc.. No group is left out of his (often funny) racist tirades. In finding them humorous I do not claim to share his views or endorse his racially insensitive remarks. It's just the way that Kowalski so proudly takes full ownership of his beliefs that make them quite funny.<br /><br />My father and other racists I have encountered had no problem offering up racist commentary but usually reserved their comments for private conversations. Walt Kowalski is way over the top, he gets right up in there face and does it. In one scene he is invited to a family gathering in a house full of Hmong people. Even though he is the only white amongst them he has no problem referring to them as 'fishheads.'<br /><br />There are interesting performances here - the young priest who challenges Kowalski to come clean with God. The Italian barber who exchanges funny and racist banter with Walt. The young Hmong siblings who befriend Walt and break down his barriers. And this is where the story leads us as Walt gets drawn into helping the young Hmong boy, Tao, who is being troubled by a violent gang. The title of the movie refers to Kowalski's mint condition 1972 Gran Torino. a classic car that he actually had a hand in building at the auto plant. In this troubled neighborhood it is coveted by friend and foe alike. Many of the Asian actors are newcomers and you would think that next to the shining star that is Eastwood they would drag down the film. For the most part that doesn't happen. I found this drama very compelling and entertaining.
Previously I thought Unforgiven was his best work, then I pre-ordered this film it is super.  I don't recommend it to anyone who is easily offended, is politically correct, racially sensitive, frowns on swearing or violence.  It is NOT for young children.  There is no sex in it so that's one taboo you don't have to worry about! If you can get past that it a "real" story about likable characters interacting in a real sort of way.
Please note that I saw this movie on HBO so I can't comment on the video quality.<br /><br />Gran Torino is perhaps both Eastwood's best movie and his best acting performance yet. He plays a crusty, grumpy, hardened Korean War veteran who doesn't take you know what from anybody. He brings a brooding, smoldering intensity to the character of a retired, working-class white man who doesn't like how his neighborhood has been taken over by various minorities and gangs over the years, becoming crime ridden and the homes falling into disrepair. In fact, he seems to be the only white guy left. But despite his racist feelings, he dislikes bullies and senseless violence even more, and when he comes to the aid of the neighboring Hmong boy when he's victimized by the local Asian gang, he unwittingly and unwillingly becomes a hero to the boy and his family.<br /><br />Eastwood strikes up an awkward friendship with the boy, and teaches him the old fashioned values he grew up with: hard work, self-reliance, independence, discipline, and integrity, values that he sees very little in evidence in his now fallen neighborhood. The scene where he teaches the boy "to talk like a man" is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in any movie, so despite the overall serious tone of the movie, it's not without its humorous moments too. Overall, it's a remarkable performance and movie from Eastwood and a fitting cap to a great career. Even if he retires after this he will have gone out at the top of his game. Not many people who are still working at age 78 can say that.
Here's a movie Eastwood made in between two "big" films, a modest film that nevertheless looked braver than what most of the indie world's been producing and completely kicked Hollywood high budget movie asses by staying at or near the top of the box office for months. And for good reason: it's a terrific movie with few stars (save a tough Eastwood) but a lot of heart.
Clint Eastwood is brilliant.  This is a movie you can watch over and over again... Tough but touching
now i am not a clint eastwood fan. he was great in The good the bad the ugly and also in dirty harry. i never this man to last so long in the movie industry spewing out one hit after another. i just watched his latest offering Gran Torino. i am BLOWN AWAY. i will recommend this movie to fans and non-fans alike. this movie is like a comedy drama. the drama builds up so much tension that when the comedy comes, i literally burst out laughing out so loud!!<br />i'll leave the story for you to read in the synopsis. eastwood is still at the top of his game and totally convincing as the disgruntled, racist, war vet. what is likeable about him is his blunt honesty. he is a racist. admits it but when he has a reason to like his neighbors, he admits that too. very realistic movie. the end was very interesting. not what i would have expected at all. but totally justified. in the end credits there is a song sung by eastwood himself. never heard him sing before. but couldn't help listening to the whole song. its a movie about a man who has been living with ghosts in his head, the only woman who ever loved him is his wife, now he is left with his second love, his 1972 Gran Torino!!
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Eastwood starts out as an old crusty bigoted, anti-Asian person. But he gradually becomes transformed by his Asian neighbors' kind, affectionate treatment into an understanding, appreciative, caring member of their family. A fascinating relationship develops between him and the neighbor teenagers--a young man and a young woman. Of all the roles I've seen Eastwood in, this by far is the best--his facial expressions say more than any words he says. His directing is simple, impactive, and straightforward--no hi-tech frills and stunts--and it serves the story quite well. The script also works well, and the ending offers a heartrending surprise, definitely against the grain for Eastwood, but thoroughly believable and exemplary. It exalts rather than degrades him, and enables him to obtain the justice required without sacrificing moral principles. Highly reccomended!!!
Well, after all the hype, I can say with complete honesty- this movie moved me in the way I was hoping it would.<br /><br />For the last several months I've been trying to find a way to watch Gran Torino.  All year long it was like the number one movie on my mind that I felt I simply HAD to watch.<br /><br />All the awards the film won, all the frequent mentions of Clint Eastwood blowing us away with his performance, and...<br /><br />the film was actually as good as most people said it would be.  This doesn't happen very often!<br /><br />I was seriously moved by the engaging storyline from beginning to end.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood playing the role of a stubborn old man that none of his family seems to care about and becoming bitter and angry at the world as a result was delivered *flawlessly*<br /><br />I'm a bit surprised the storyline focused so much on Clint's character building a relationship between his neighbors and himself, and less on the part about trying to protect his home from the never-ending gang fights taking place outside.<br /><br />The actual gang fights were about 50% of the film, while the other half dealt with Clint and the young boy from next store getting to know each other better and building a friendship through patience, hard work and a willingness for Clint to finally open up and accept his neighbors.<br /><br />This is truly a great movie with an ending that might move you in a way you've never felt before.  It's a bit of a shocking ending to me, but I guess the more I think about it while typing up this review, it's the kind of ending to be expected.<br /><br />I can't think of another way to make the outcome more realistic, while also keeping in mind that the intention of the writers while putting together this film was to make an impact on the viewers, let's put it that way.<br /><br />There's a couple hidden messages behind the storyline as well- always accept others, don't be so quick to judge, and never follow through with your initial reactions.  There's also a message that you can in fact change people who are always in trouble with the law.<br /><br />Overall, yeah, this movie is simply terrific the entire way through.  A brilliant job by everyone involved.
Gran Torino(WideScreen Edition DVD):<br /><br />Let me start by Saying I am a big Clint fan, however I won't go see Invictus because it seems to be typical Mandela Propaganda(he's a Communist/castrolover), So I am disappointed Clint Directed that Film,That Said, This movie Should Have won Best Movie! I am not one for Redemption movies, but Thought Clint did a Great job, The Car,Sadly A Ford Gran Torino 1972, (I like Vettes.then Chevy/GM) doesn't do much nor do you hear the engine roar(or Sputter?-Ford)But the point is the movie, the Acting, The Main Character's Family, and how they could care less about him and just want him to croak or live in a Old Folks Home*Near Typical American family* is very sad.People don't have any morals or respect anymore,especially the youth(and Btw I am 27,was raised different). The movie may not be Politically Correct for some of the puritanical people out there because of the Slurs and such,But the movie is a Winner.
All the intellectual reviews and evaluations of this film are fine, but what I know is that I am still feeling this movie in my gut long after I watched it. Cut my male macho bulls*** right off at the knees. Awesome film making, incredible performance by an actor and director at the epitome of his craft.Gran Torino engaged me emotionally is ways I did not expect, and I was the biggest guy in the room. Buy it.
Nice to see how Clint's character changed his tune after getting to know the neighbors. Its an eye opener on the reality of gang violence too. The movie was sad though as he made the ultimate sacrifice to save the kids and teach them to make the right choices. Clint Eastwood was great.
So,this is Clint Eastwood's last movie as an actor.He did a very good job in closing out a wonderful career.The movie made me angry about the street gang he takes on and it shows how our youth today are destroying their lives.His character is one person who is not afraid to back down from a threat.I did see some Dirty Harry in the movie.The trailer to the movie was great.Although this is his last movie as an actor and now he is going behind the camera I will always be a Clint Eastwood fan.
I wasn't that interested in going to the movie as I'm not a Dirty Harry fan or anything, but what a great movie. If you are offended by racial jokes - do not watch, but me and my husband found it freaking hilarious. Great story, very captivating, and a tear jerker. A definite must own.
Gran Torino was, in this person's opinion, Clint Eastwood's finest movie.  I won't divulge any of the story, but it was very true to life for the older generation; a way of life that no longer will exist for young people.  All I can say is "well done"!
It was imperfect in all the ways that don't matter, and perfect in the ways that do.  I loved it.
In the twilight of most actors careers you wouldn't think they could put out such powerful films! But holy moly this film touched my heart and had me reaching for the kleenex. Clint plays a guy that everyone has either known or met in their lives. It's a film for anyone from 16 to 100. Please make this film one to see! If you want to have your heart warmed and a good cry please see it!
One of the best I have seen.  The seller rating is a 5 as well.  My order was processed quickly and I received the movie in only a few days.  Will use seller again.
There was a time when I couldn't have believed I could actually enjoy the rough,<br />violent, anti-PC atmosphere of a film with the name "Clint Eastwood" attached to it.<br />Not only did I enjoy this film, I found it to be the most wonderfully touching,<br />funny, heartwrenching movie I've seen in a long, long time. That it is all that,<br />yet still remains faithful to the Eastwood rough, violent, anti-PC image, is a<br />remarkable feat.<br /><br />  Even the most successful film directors reach a point in their careers when their<br />output begins to fade as they get to retirement age. Clint Eastwood is the rare<br />exception. At 78, he has hit his peak with this film. As recently widowed, embittered Korean war veteran Walt Kowalski, he seems ready to live out the twilight<br />of his years sitting on his front porch and grousing about the stinkin' world. But<br />when the next-door neighbors, a family of Hmong immigrants, are threatened by the<br />local gangs, he finds himself goin' for his guns and standing up against the thugs<br />in the tradition of Charles Bronson in "Death Wish."<br /><br />  But what starts out as a vigilante revenge story quickly blossoms into a moving<br />drama as Kowalski warms (in his gritty, teeth-clenched fashion) to his neighbors.<br />He takes the family's son under his wing and teaches him lessons about life, work,<br />and romance. Just when you think the story is edging toward sentimentality, there<br />is a sudden, shocking twist, one that Kowalski and his surrogate son struggle to<br />overcome. Which Kowalski eventually does, in a poignant ending that both resolves<br />his crises and redeems his life. It is one of the most spiritually satisfying<br />endings of any films in recent years.<br /><br />  If you don't think you're the type to enjoy a Clint Eastwood film, think again.<br />Don't pass this one up!
This is Clint Eastwood at his best, showing us that even in darkness there is light, and even in death there is value. I must say this is probably up there with his better works like Unforgiven.
Don't know how many more movies Clint will act in, but this is a typically outstanding movie/story for him as an actor/director. Sure I'm a big fan, but you gotta love the way he tells a story. He depicts the contrast of the generations and cultures to a "T". I wish I could say this is my favorite movie of his, but I just can't single out one of his works. He has so many that have evoked earnest thought and entertainment. Did I mention just plain "escape fiction". One of the best actor/directors of our time.
This is possibly one of the best movies I've seen in a long time - I really appreciated the movie's theme. I think this is a movie I can watch every other month. (If it were every month then there would be less suspense because I'd know what's coming....).
Wow.<br />A great, great movie.<br />Its larger than life themes are about being a hero, being an American, and being human.<br />You probably have to like Clint to love it, but I can also tell you that it's one of his best if not his best ever.
I am not a big Clint fan, pretty much take him or leave him but this movie is excellent!  It touches your heart and your sense of justice.  Not just for men, women will love this movie too.
Eastwood has many great movies but in my opinion "Gran Torino" is the best. One that you can watch several times.
Gran torino was great and i loved it. It was great movie making every scene was great.Every scene was cut great i got it the day it came out on dvd i love it
A brilliant script with many memorable lines delivered by Clint, most of which are not suitable to print here.  The story is touching and illuminating.  Fine acting is the other ingredient to this wonderful film about people... about ourselves.  The film touches on a vast many aspects of life including growing old, family, gang violence, prejudices, life, death, etc. So many in fact, it may seem like a mishmash to some, but the story knits them together well.<br /><br />Sitting at the opposite end of the spectrum from some earlier films such "Every Which Way But Loose", this is among Eastwood's more cerebral films.  Although rated R for very strong language and violence, it is not an action adventure film but rather a thought provoking film along the lines of "Unforgiven".<br /><br />My only minor constructive criticism is that the first act moves a little slow and the film does not develop its momentum until about ten minutes in.  Perhaps the opening scenes could have been cut a little tighter.<br /><br />Bottom line, I enjoyed this film and highly recommend it.
This movie was tender and well done.<br /><br />However it wasnt what i thought it would be..an ACTION movie.<br />Once i got over that fact I enjoyed this movie for its excellent acting and direction.<br /><br />Warm and well woven, the main character Clint plays has many layers..even a soft one despite his crusty exterior.<br /><br />All and all, I am glad I purchased "Gran Torino"
I watched it three times, and my brother watched it two. That's how good the film is. It has to one of the best that Eastwood has ever made and, if this is Eastwood's last film he will act in, a fitting end to a great acting career.
Clint Eastwood is extraordinary. He acts, he directs, he produces, and even has an active hand in the music. If any human deserved and Oscar for this production it was Mr. Eastwood. He reminds me of a really fine wine, the older he gets, the better he gets. God Speed, Clint.
This is by far one of the best films to come in a long time. Eastwood's Kowalski is so completely human .. a hardened exterior created by his war experience, working 50 years in Detroit's auto factories, struggling to hold onto his life in the form of his home after his wife dies and the neighborhood changes.<br /><br />The friendship he develops with the Chinese teen is real. The scene where Eastwood has learned he is dying of lung cancer, and calls his shallow family on the phone and they blow him off really hit home.<br /><br />This is a film about a tough everyman, who stands-up to adversity, the tragedy of his past and failed family, and has a real impact on some young people for whom he initially has nothing but contempt. This is Eastwood's best, and he shows a dimension of himself that hasn't been seen before.
This great script about personal redemption & the values that unite us, regardless of race, is not only laugh out loud hilarious thanks to more instantly quotable one-liners than I can recall in any movie from recent years, but also incredibly moving.<br /><br />Unlike so many other directors who showboat their style in a 'Hey Ma, look at me! I'm directing a movie!' kind of way, Eastwood's direction is like a gentle breeze, it's so light, so delicate, you're barely even aware of it. Instead you're right where you want to be be; engrossed in the story & gripped by these wonderful characters. And what a story!<br /><br />Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is an elderly widower surrounded by Hmong immigrants with foreign ways that he despises, living in a decrepit neighborhood & pestered by his own ghastly family who can't wait to shove him into a retirement home so they can grab his house. He keeps his own home & property neatly tendered, in stark contrast to those around him. Walt is, in effect, the proverbial civilised man surrounded by the barbarians.<br /><br />But when Tao, the shy Hmong kid from next door is pressured by a local gang into trying to steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino, the stage is set for a culture clash. That Walt ends up befriending Tao probably won't come as a surprise but the exact manner in which Walt warms to his Hmong neighbors, his mysterious guilt over an incident from his Korean war days, how Tao learns to stand on his own two feet & the presence of the Hmong gang who haven't forgotten Tao, are developed & resolved in wholly unexpected ways. We think we know where this is going simply because we've all seen Eastwood films before. But just as he did with Million Dollar Baby, Eastwood has one heck of a surprise in store, an ending that not only cuts deep but makes perfect sense & in ways we had not anticipated.<br /><br />To say more would spoil the fun but Eastwood's fearless, pull no punches approach to race & culture is an absolute blast from start to finish, & Eastwood the actor is electrifying in the lead role. There is something thrilling in the way a nearly 80 yr old man can hold the screen so effortlessly. Other stars lose charisma as they age but Eastwood's only seems to increase. As one reviewer noted, this is possibly the only film in the history of American cinema in which a 78 yr old man convincingly kicks the ass of a guy 60 years his junior!<br /><br />Aside from Clint the young cast of non-professional Hmong actors are all fine with Bee Vang (Tao), & Ahney Herr (Sue), believable & likable as the young Hmong teens next door. They have an un-Hollywood quality to them that makes their performances pleasingly natural & amongst the professional cast Christopher Carley (as Fthr Janovitch) & John Carroll Lynch (Martin the Barber) are excellent.<br /><br />I don't believe for a second that this is Eastwood's final screen performance & after Gran Torino's huge success - it ranks as Eastwood's most profitable film ever at the box-office - the studios doubtless can't get enough scripts to him fast enough. But if it is then Eastwood has found a role that's the perfect capstone to the urban tough guys he's so memorably played over the decades.<br /><br />When Walt walks off to that final showdown, quite willing to go to the wall for those who share his values, it's impossible not to sense the ghosts of Harry Callahan & The Man With No Name walking with him. "The world is nothing more than all the tiny things you left behind.. " runs the beautiful ballad sung by Clint & Jamie Cullum that closes the film. It's just one of many pearls of wisdom in this profoundly moving, hugely entertaining & beautiful work of art.
Excellent movie.  Clint Eastwood is one of the greats and knows what it takes to make a good movie.  I liked the "real life" scenario, his friendship with the neighbors and the reality of the children and grandchildren. Very entertaining!
Gran Torino is slated to be Clint Eastwood's final acting role, announcing plans on a career move seated behind the camera in directing films rather than staring in them.  Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a far cry from his man with no name spagetti western and Dirty Harry days, while retaining the gruff razor's edge toughness the actor is noted for.  Sitting on his porch like the last Dinasaur attempting to retain what little remains of his declining domain, Korean War vet Walt drinks Pabsts Blue Ribbon Beer and smokes Lucy Strikes disgusted by the changes which have taken place in his once blue collar inner city neighborhood.  Eastwod winds up mentoring his young Korean neighbor after the boy's failed attempt at stealing Walt's vintage 1972 Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation.  This film is the perfect curtain call for Eastwood's acting career and should go down as one of his best performances.
This movie is pretty good, its good, but in the end it will get you emotional!
Some have criticized "Gran Torino" as being too simple, cliched and hurt by the performances of the film's first-time actors.<br />But this is one of those rare movies that's bigger than the sum of its parts. In recent years, I have yet to see a film that managed to get both men and women to cry. And that it would provoke such strong emotions is not evident until the last act.<br />It may seem simple and cliched on the surface, and while I knew that Clint Eastwood's character Walt would eventually warm up to his Hmong neighbors, I didn't expect that the movie would also have me, a guy who doesn't cry at movies, wiping my eyes. And not just once, but the three other times I saw the film at the theater. And I heard other people crying at every viewing.<br />Each time I viewed it, it was just as powerful, if not more.<br />Walt is an old, bitter racist, who just about hates everyone, including the young pastor who visits him regularly at the request of Walt's late wife, and his own children and their families.<br />On paper, the story seems simple, but its power is hard to deny. It's part drama, part comedy, part tale of one man's racist surface, but as the credits roll, you realize that the power of the movie, the emotional buttons it pushes, make this a movie that rises above the acting, above its direction, above its script, to make something deeper and emotionally touching than most would have expected.<br />There are subtle touches and small scenes that any other director would not have folded into the film. And they do go by like a breeze for the most part. They'll have you laughing, smiling or shaking your head.<br />And it's good that Eastwood's character does not make a complete (and unrealistic) 360 degree turn, as you see in most American movies.<br />And given what Eastwood has delivered in most of his movies, most notably as Dirty Harry and his various Westerns, you expect a big showdown to come, and that showdown does come, but not with the ending you expect.<br />Eastwood has made powerful movies before, but this one really seemed to touch the core of many people, across many age groups, and racial/ethnic designations.<br />On a side note, Eastwood has also done what so many Hollywood studios and filmmakers choose not to do, which is portray Asian-Americans as regular, everyday people, living in America. That's no small feat, as most Hollywood studios go out of their way to not cast Asian-Americans and not show the lives of Asian-Americans. They rather change the race of the characters, even when they're basing a movie on a real-life story about Asian-American people, or offer easy, ignorant stereotypes.<br />Eastwood only deserves credit, because it's something that should have been done decades ago.<br />And while this movie may not get much kudos from the snobby critics in the big film world, it has a emotional pull that even some recent Eastwood movies don't have.<br />It may not have won any big awards, but it's a movie I plan on watching for years to come.
With 175 reviews to read you probably won't get around to reading mine. But Gran Torino may just be Clint Eastwood's finest acting, and it certainly one of the best films he's directed. It's both iconic - building on Dirty Harry and Unforgiven - and subtle. As an actor friend of mine once said back in the late 1970's about Clint: "He's got one look. But boy, is it a good look."<br /><br />Gran Torino is the embodiment of that statement. When Clint levels his rifle at the scum, and says he could blow their heads off, go in, and sleep like a baby, he's probably the only man on earth you'd believe saying something like that. His eyes, his carriage, his intensity.<br /><br />Underneath that patented Dirty Harry glare is a performance of such subtlety, minute inflections, and being it's virtuoso. He's like a worn out pair of jeans, a well-oiled and used baseball mitt. Clint Eastwood uses his entire body of work as a back drop to this performance, and builds on it to take us along for the ride.<br /><br />I'm not going to share the plot as others have so far. It's a film about values and tradition. About accountability. Doing the right thing - up to and including making sure his old dog is taken care of. What's masterful about the film is that he takes what could have been a caricature in the hands of another actor and director and makes it believable.<br /><br />Much has been made of his racist language. At first it's jarring. It's so all encompasing and over the top in the beginning of the film you can't help but concentrate on it. But he takes it from Archie Bunker territory with character development and plot arc to the point where you no longer actually hear the stupid words. You are too focused on the man's character and who he really is. A real racist would never have entered his neighbor's home, and certainly wouldn't have eaten their food. The reviewer who said he's racist because he doesn't know any other way to be is spot-on.<br /><br />The Hmong cast is outstanding. I especially loved the interaction between Walt and Grandma - two peas in a pod. Bee Vang as Tow was solid as the boy who becomes a man. Ahney Her as Sue is the driver of the changes in Walt. If she couldn't hold her own with Clint the film wouldn't have worked. She does, and in the bargain, Gran Torino is a very satisfying, impressive film.<br /><br />Like Gran Torinos, and Clint Eastwood, they don't make 'em like this anymore.
This is a phenomenally good film about an elderly man who can come to see things in a new light.  While I think it is too easy to describe him as a racist, he is of the glib, crusty, irascible curmugeon type.  Indeed, he reminds me of my father - hard-edged and seemingly offensive (some people would get hurt and insulted, to be sure), but in fact with a good heart and natural nobility.  Eastwood plays it with unmistakable charisma.  I marvelled at the skill with which Eastwood pealed away layers of his character, from his crudeness to his soul-searching and ethic of community.<br /><br />The situation is that, his wife having died and his sons alienated, he is wondering what to do with himself.  He is rude to his Hmong neighbors, but comes to see them as truly worthy people in need of help and nurturing.  His evolution from suspicion and a playful hostility with the Hmong grandmother are totally believable.  In particular, he befirends a boy who is at a crossroads, even taking him to a barber in order to teach him how to trade manly insults.  Their chemistry as it evolves is beautiful, to the point of bringing tears to my eyes.  When his plans to help go awry, he hatches a very clever plan.<br /><br />I watched this twice and was moved each time and noticed more detail.  It is a masterpiece and an unusual story for Hollywood to do.  Warmly recommended.
The Academy went down yet another notch in my estimation for all but ignoring this masterpiece from the master, Clint Eastwood. Others here have described the rich plot. The group of unknown Vietnamese actors are PERFECTLY led by Clint Eastwood, as the silent, grouchy, proud, imperfect, highly principled American guy we all know--or wish we knew better. Gran Torino is poignant, at times funny, and inspirational. It could be Clint Eastwood's career best, Dirty Harry come full urban-American circle. Shame on you, Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. You goofed by ignoring a lot of classics we all love now, and you goofed on this, big time. (And they wonder why ratings for the Oscar show continue to dive, year after year.)<br /><br />Highly recommended.
This is an outstanding film, brought to us by a legend of the industry.  This movie has it all: solid acting, great characters, cinematography, pace, and plot.  This film will make you think, and this film will make you feel.<br /><br />Eastwood is simply great in the tailor-made role of Walt Kowalski.  Like any great actor, he shows you all the dimensions of his character.  At first, you think he's just a cranky old man.  Then, his bigotry is front and center.  Little by little, you begin to understand him and why he is the way he is. Before you know it, you are identifying with, and sympathizing with, a guy who needs love more than contempt.  Of course, he does find his redemption, through the most unilkely of people.<br /><br />That Clint Eastwood is great in this film should come as no surprise.  The real surprise comes via two completely inexperienced actors, Ahney Her as Sue, and Bee Vang as Thao.  These two most unwelcome next door neighbors help Walt find his redemption, and give him the love and respect he gets from no one else.  Sharing the screen with Eastwood is no small task for any actor, no matter how experienced they might be. These two rose to the occasion.<br /><br />The details is this film are just perfect.  The casting is excellent, from top to bottom.  Eastwood's son, daughter-in-law, and grandaughter are played to perfection by Brian Haley, Geraldine Hughes, and Dreama Walker.  They are self-absorbed and clueless as to the needs of Walt.  Walker is the teenager you love to hate, especially when she is lusting after Walt's prize Gran Torino in anticipation of his ultimate death.  Haley and Hughes' good scene was when they showed up to Walt's house with what they thought were perfect birthday gifts.  The gifts of a "grabber" and a phone with huge numbers to this man who was still so vital was tasteless.  The scene played out perfectly.<br /><br />The extras and smaller parts were fantastic as well.  I especially enjoyed watching the thugs and gangbangers.  They looked great and were very believable.  The locations in gritty Detroit were just right.  Whatever time Eastwood and Team spent scouting locations really paid off.<br /><br />Finally, to release this most un-PC of films in hypersensitive Hollywood was ballsy on Eastwood's part.  You will hear more racial slurs than you thought existed.  These slurs are not gratuitous; rather, they define the Walt character and make his actions all the more important.<br /><br />Don't miss this one.  Highly recommended.
Walt Kowalski is a Korean war vet and a retired auto worker. He has lost his wife and has seen his neighborhood deteriorate. He lashes out with hatred and contempt at everyone around him. Underneath all of this though is a man with high morals and a real sense of what's right and wrong. This is easily the most powerful acting performance of Clint Eastwood's career. He was snubbed for the Oscars, but no matter. This is the performance of a lifetime, even outdistancing his role in "Million Dollar Baby". Eastwood also produces and directs this drama that takes us deep inside Walt Kowalski's soul. The ending is an absolute shocker too. Rumor has it that this is Eastwood's final film as an actor. If this is so, then he has saved his best for last. It is the partial ending (hopefully he will continue to produce and direct) of the career of one of America's greatest film makers.
The Gran Torino with Clint Eastwood should be given the best director, actor, screenplay.  This was the best movie Clint Eastwood has done in a long time.  It is definitely superior above all those other nominees in 2008.
I've watched this flick over 5 times and it never gets old.  Eastwood is a true icon in cinema and this movie confirms it.  Mr. Eastwood, thank you.
Didn't hear much buzz about this while it was in theaters and had no interest in seeing it because I misread it as a touchy-feely racial harmony film. I was completely wrong. This is a great movie, a classic, in so many ways. It was 100% the opposite of what I expected. I wouldn't have minded if it were 5 hours long thats how much I enjoyed it.
"Gran Torino" is a gem of a movie that once again affirms Clint Eastwood's brilliant abilities. From beginning till end, I found my attention transfixed on the screen, the story is that compelling.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski who has recently been widowed. He seems irascible, perpetually squinting in disapproval, basically a curmudgeon. He does not seem to have a loving relationship with his two grown sons who are both married with families of their own. Walt is also something of a racist, spewing some racial slurs at the Hmong family that has moved next door.<br /><br />Within this setting, Walt's path crosses that of the Hmong family next door with some surprising results - the young Hmong teenager, a boy named Thao [Bee Vang] is an alienated teen who is being pressured by a group of Hmong gang members to join them. Although Thao is disinterested, he is forced by the gang to steal a prized 72' Gran Torino from Kowalski's garage. The attempt fails when Thao is interrupted by Kowalski, and this acts as a catalyst for all the events that follow.<br /><br />The gang members, infuriated by Thao's failure, return to bash him up, but are faced with Kowalski's wrath instead [he just wanted them off his lawn]. Later, Kowalski rescues Thao's sister, Sue [Ahney Her] from being harassed by a group of black guys and she worms her way into Kowalski's good graces, taking all the slurs in her stride and eventually gaining Kowalski's genuine affection. Gradually the Hmongs next door cease to become just another group of "gooks" but like a real family to Kowalski, something he has never really had, except with his beloved late wife. But, the Hmong gang refuses to let Thao alone and this sets off a chain of events that truly reveal the depth of Kowalski's bond to the family.<br /><br />There are so many complex themes explored in this movie - aging, loneliness, racism, peer pressure, evil , faith, courage, alienation, and many more. Yet, in Mr Eastwood's capable hands, these myriad themes are all linked together in a seamless fashion, giving viewers a movie with real soul - insightful and deep, and thought-provoking. The climax when it comes, is simply mind-blowing and so very beautifully executed, delivering a powerful message.<br /><br />The movie is definitely carried by Eastwood's portrayal of Kowalski as the old racist war vet who in fact embodies real courage, steely determination and plenty of heart. The actors portraying the Hmong seemed rather stilted in their performances, especially Bee Vang's Thao, though I liked Ahney Her's portrayal of the acerbic and candid Sue. There was also another highlight performance, that of the Catholic priest, Father Janovich [Christopher Carley] who seems initially way out of his depth in trying to get Walt to confession [as per Walt's late wife's wishes], and whose baby-face actually belies a strong character, determined to do the right thing.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is a gem of a movie, and is one of those rare dramas of substance that had me pondering about issues long after the credits rolled.
Eastwood at his best. This one proves he's the best, and that he can act AND direct very well. This is an excellent story, great cast, excellent acting. Very believeable.
I initially begged off seeing "Gran Torino" as I assumed I got the gist from preview trailers, but you know what happens when you assume, right?  I was expecting the clich&eacute;d Clint Eastwood ending and after seeing "Gran Torino" was instead quite stunned and surprised, yet I shouldn't have been.  If anything Eastwood has evolved far beyond the "Dirty Harry" days and if anything has become as much as an artist in front of the lens as behind it.  Thinking of his more recent movies, Eastwood has transcended his earlier on-screen personas and evolved into something far deeper.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is as much character driven as plot driven and Eastwood's character Harvey Kowalski is as much the antithesis of Dirty Harry as he is the antithesis of a vigilante.  A retired autoworker and Korean War Veteran, Kowalski is also a recent widower watching the transition and decline of his Detroit neighborhood where he and his late wife raised their children.  When touching on his somewhat estranged children "Gran Torino" becomes a vehicle for satire, emphasizing the dislocation and detachment of modern society.  Kowalski feels about as connected to his children and grandchildren as he does to the equally alien Hmong family next door.  Opening with the funeral service for his late wife "Gran Torino" sets the tableau of dislocation and despair in his neighborhood.  Kowalski's antagonism and dislocation with seemingly everyone is pled out with his neighbors, his children, the parish priest, and his neighborhood.  The feelings of rejection and helplessness pervade the movie: children give up on parents, parents give up on children, neighbors give up on their community and the community crumbles around them.  Without giving the plot away events unfold where Kowalski feels compelled to intervene on behalf of his neighbors and the community reacts in a way that catches Kowalski off-guard.  Slowly Kowalski is pulled closer into the Hmong community as he grapples with his wartime demons and his distant children.  The closer Kowalski gets to the Hmong the more the film builds to its stunning climax, and the climax is unlike anything you'd expect form a Clint Eastwood movie.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the ending, but much like "Million Dollar Baby" and other recent Eastwood movies your mouth will be hanging open as it is not the ending you would expect.  That's because Eastwood has truly become the cinematic master, defying expectations and here offering up a sharp contrast that made me a fan of his work all over again.  There wasn't as much violence as I expected, and Eastwood totally chews up the scenery with an economy of words that are truly impressive.  His facial expressions communicate more than words ever could.  There is some VERY politically incorrect language presented quite frankly here but it serves a purpose.  I'd questioned how good "Gran Torino" could be and it is easily one of the best movies of the past year, if not one of Eastwood's best.  It is a fitting coda to every Dirty Harry movie and all of his Spaghetti Westerns rolled into one.  I've often thought that Eastwood approaches each film as though it might be his last and never holds anything back.  If "Gran Torino" were to be his final film it would be hard to imagine going out on a better note!

Received the DVD before the projected date. Purchased a used disc and was in fine condition. This is one of Clint's best movies ever. Funny and tearful and a good coming of age story. Everybody that has seen this movie has something positive to say about it. Great movie.
You have to buy this movie! Oh my god, this movie is the most beautiful crime film ever (ironic huh?)! Clint Eastwood sure knows how to act, and the ending made me cry. This film has everything, action, suspense, tradgey, even a little humor. This film is a true masterpiece. Don't listen to the bad reviews!
This was a very good movie. It's pretty much about how an old grump, who lost his wife and gets caught up in a neighborhood war. When he catches a young boy trying to steal his prize car, who is being forced to join a gang. The old grump screws up the young boy's initiation and saves him in the process. Which makes him a hero to the whole neighborhood. However, the gang wants retribution and is willing to do anything, to get it. So, the old grump must figure out a way to protect the boy, his family and the neighborhood from the gang's revenge.
This was a great movie.  The commercials didn't do it justice.  It may offend some in the beginning, but you really need to watch it all the way through.  I laughed, I cried, I got irritated w/Clint's character, but still an excellent movie.  Just make sure your children are in bed.  It's not a movie I'd let my kids watch.
Good movie, reminded me of my husband, he was a Korean vet.  Had a interesting ending.
"Gran Torino" is a different kind of Clint Eastwood movie.  Yes he still has a gun (you will have to see how he uses it) but his character is different from any that I have seen him play again.  In this movie, Eastwood plays the role of Walt Kowalski, an elderly, crotchety, widower, who, living with his legacy from the Korean War, gradually comes to terms with his ethnically changing, gang infested neighborhood.  Key characters include his Hmong neighbors, played by Bee Vang, Ahney Her and a young priest, played by Christopher Carley.  All turn in compelling performances as they slowly gain new understandings of those around them.  As the story progresses, Kowlaski moves from a not very likable old man to a personification of the Christ motif found so often in literature.  By the end, the viewer realizes that he is viewing a modern Morality Play.
This movie was well directed. It illustrates the growth that people can  make if they really look past their past. Clint Eastwood gives, as always, a fine performance and the redemption of his character is bittersweet. All in all, I enjoyed this film. It stays with you.
This was a fantastic movie.  It portrayed a grumpy old veteran who has all his old stereotypes perfectly.  Clint Eastwood made a great choice when he decided this was his last film.<br /><br />The characters, though maybe not the best actors, still have a lot of dynamic to them - something that you miss in a lot of recent movies.  The priest is a good man who cares about his flock, which is a much better (and true) representation of a Catholic priest than any other movies that have come out lately with a priest in it.<br /><br />I would watch this over No Country for Old Men any day.
This was a great movie! The item was delivered ahead of schedule and we were highly satisfied with the item and the expedient arrival.
Clint once again takes a modern day good vs. bad, bully vs. hero story and educates the audience at the same time by highlighting cultural diversity and reminding us of our prejudices.  He gives hope for peace through violence with a twist. He fights both inward and outer demons with angelic intent.
I saw this film alone in the theatre, as my wife is Asian, and having seen the reviews, I figured that the dialog and language would be somewhat sensitive and racially charged. I was definitely correct in that conclusion. My father turns 80 this year and easily could have played the role of Walt, a man who has never quite understood the concept of political correctness, or the need to welcome people who his own generation has seen war against.<br /><br />I can also attest to the spot-on accuracy of the portrayal of the Hmong family. The neighbor matriarch, the family party and the changing roles between the older and younger generations are all shown with absolute clarity. I have been to the exact types of gatherings that Walt was invited to, and the film portrays it superlatively.<br /><br />I can also appreciate that Eastwood can go beyond the role of Dirty Harry. I am one who believes that Clint is at his best in his deeper, more reflective roles. Think "Unforgiven" and "Million Dollar Baby" rather than "Sudden Impact". It is good to see that in the twilight of his career, Eastwood can still show his range.<br /><br />The ending will not be for everyone, but I think no great movie will be. I think this is a film that will best be appreciated by anyone who has asked the hard questions of life relating to "What's next?"...the questions that have no clear answer, other than the seeking of redemption and atonement, and the desire to do for others that which they cannot do for themselves. Not a bad way to wrap things in life up, in my opinion.
Finally, this great movie is coming to DVD!  In my opinion, this is Clint's best movie since 1976's "The Enforcer" his third Dirty Harry film.  In recent films, Clint has been a little soft and too nice of a guy. He is back in action in this great film that is also a wonderful story!  This movie reminds me very much of John Wayne's last film, "The Shootist".  In both films, Duke and Clint take a boy under their wing and mentor them.  There are many other similarities that I won't say because I'll be giving away the plot.  I can't wait to own this great Clint Eastwood film!
Gran Torino was a surprisingly emotional experience for me, both due to it being one of Eastwood's most affecting and human movies, and because my Dad loved Clint and we used to see all his films together. Clint has made some real classics, and this ranks with any of them in its own unique way.<br /><br />Schenk's script keeps getting better as the film moves along; the opening scene is almost ham-handed exposition, telling us everything we need to know right away instead of showing it. That's the weakest moment of the film, though, and as we dig into Walt's character Clint informs him with many perfect and telling details, visually and verbally. Eastwood is totally inside this role, an absolutely masterful performance that should have won the Oscar hands down, and his direction is equally crisp. Rarely has a director acted so well, and vice-versa.<br /><br />There are many perfect moments here, from Walt's family trying to make sure they're in his will but never spending time with him, Walt's exchanges with his barber, his love of his talismanic Torino, and above all his growing love towards his Hmong neighbors. One of the best things about the blu-ray version is the extra doc about making the movie, a very fine little piece with some great Clint interviews that makes clear how careful he was to get all the cultural details right in this (very rare) cinematic look at Hmong culture in the US.<br /><br />Here we see a very mature Eastwood, in all the best ways. Dirty Harry has progressed into the sort of quietly loving being that was his destiny all along, and I believe that's what my Dad always loved about Clint: under all that toughness and edge is a truly intelligent and compassionate man who knows that the underdog is oft worth fighting for, and that the values we carry in our hearts are what define us in our most difficult times. The old Clint revenge motif is as usual in full force, but this time there's more soul in it than is sometimes the case, and the unexpected ending truly makes it clear that Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name have learned a lot in the past four decades.<br /><br />We've been watching plenty of films this very hot summer (thank goodness there's no global warming! It would really be hot, not just 105 most every day for the past month), and this is one of the only ones I can recall where about halfway in I suddenly hoped the movie would never end. I wanted to see Walt grow and develop; Clint's performance is just that good, certainly one of his best.<br /><br />There is also a lot of wonderfully wry humor, especially if you know any semi-bigots who are deep down very just and decent people. Clint's not afraid to poke fun at himself or Archie Bunkers or anything else by this point, and there are some hilarious lines that come out of nowhere. Walt's little grunts say more than any dialogue. I don't think Walt would ever say "colored guy", but Clint's knowing that the N-word would unnecessarily offend a lot of folks makes that line acceptable if unrealistic in this context. It's one of the film's few odd moments but doesn't detract at all.<br /><br />The music is also very fine, simple but moving, and Eastwood's son Kyle (what a great name, another sign of Clint's genius) has progressed a lot in the last 20 years. If Clint's basic but heartfelt singing over the credits doesn't bring tears to your eyes, you're a stronger man than I, and welcome to it. When Clint makes you cry you know something special has happened; this is a long way from Detective Callahan and even Unforgiven, another masterpiece.<br /><br />But the best thing here is the growth of Clint's love for Thao and Sue, his young Hmong neighbors who show him more real love than his own family. The bond between Walt and Thao is one of the more touching screen relationships I have ever seen, and it really becomes affecting as the film evolves. Wonderful acting from both of these hitherto unknown players makes this movie glow with a feeling unlike anything Eastwood has ever done, and it's seeing one of our great American film heroes become Walt so completely that makes this movie truly special.<br /><br />I had no idea this film would be anywhere near this fine, and rarely have I missed my Dad more since his death. He would have loved Gran Torino in so many ways, and I can't recommend enough that any fathers and sons out there see this film together. It has a lot to say about men and how we relate to each other and ourselves. It made me realize yet again that my old man knew what was up in many ways that only getting older can reveal to me, and that I sure was lucky to have him for a father. Any film that can bring that home so forcefully, and with so much laughter amongst the pathos, is nothing other than a true classic.<br /><br />This movie will live a long life and eventually be seen as one of the finest of our era. It's a fitting end to Eastwood's stellar career, one of the American cinema's most interesting. Or is it the end? Clint, man of many surprises, may still have one or two up his sleeve....<br /><br />Not bad for a 78-year-old old man.
There are many things to like about Gran Torino. The thing I appreciate most is its authenticity. There is nothing in "Gran Torino" that makes you stop and say "Now wait a minute - it wouldn't happen that way". The story takes place in-or-near Detroit - and it is very obvious that it was filmed in the Detroit area.... again everything has a real authentic feal.<br /><br />  The story is a coming-to-age story of a man in his "senior" years (I know that is a weird way to start an "coming-to-age" movie). Eastwood's character is recently widowed retired autoworker who is perpetually unhappy in his bigoted ways. Through a series of events he discovers that he has more respect for his new immigrant neighbors than he does for his own kids. I won't go into too many of the details - but nothing feels contrived or forced in terms of the plot development.<br /><br />  "Gran Torino" is a multi-layered story tale on respect and redemption. The story is very tight and well-written with artistic qualities that are often seen in novels, but rarely in big-budget Hollywood films. While the story is not for everyone (definitely NOT for kids) I think that all of Eastwood's fans will be more than a little satisfied.<br /><br />Final Verdict - "Gran Torino" is a great movie, and in many ways it the equal of "Millionaire Baby". While there are a couple of acting weak points (in my opinion the priest was the weakest) the whole story is excellent and highly recommended.<br />5 stars
Clint Eastwood is a great actor, a great director, a jazz musician and an ass-kicker when he has to be; with Gran Torino he uses all of these skills.<br /><br />Clint portrays Walt Kowalski, a retired auto-worker, a man who's life is a juxtaposition of his wife's death, his disconnect with his children and grandchildren, his Korean War memories and lastly his own mortality. He lives in a neighborhood emptied of friends, most who have moved or passed away to be replaced by Hmong immigrants from Southeast Asia. Walt and his Hmong neighbors understanding of each other and eventual friendship is what this film is about.<br /><br />Walt is tough, but not your typical tough-guy; he show's a range of emotions through out the film. And Gran Torino is not your typical shoot em' up revenge film, it's much more cerebral than that. Oh, there's action alright, and Walt's nobody to mess with, but Gran Torino is more "Unforgiven" than "Dirty Harry". It's a complex story, with complex characters living a "gritty" existence.<br /><br />A very good film by any standards, and a must see film for Eastwood fans.<br /><br />Oh yes, Kyle Eastwood did a nice job with the soundtrack. The title track performed by Jamie Cullum is excellent. Very haunting. Nice jazz.
I rented Gran Torino from Amazon.com the weekend of July fourth 2009. Great movie from start to finish. I like all Clint Eastwood's work.<br /><br />This one particularly kept me in my seat the whole length of the film. The surprise ending had me floored. The ending has to be seen to believe it. Watch or rent this movie to see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil the movie for others by talking about what happens in the film, because I strongly feel this is a movie everyone should watch. It's really good.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is a great man with great talent that has brought us entertainment for decades.<br /><br />I give Gran Torino a very strong five star review after watching the rental from Amazon. Yes!, I do plan on buying the DVD for my collection.<br /><br />Reporter Joseph Toth<br />Washington Micro Bank BBS
Awesome....aside from the slightly comedic and offending stream of racial wit back and forth in this movie...its just about the best Clint Eastwood movie there is. But I understand the necessity of his extreme portrayal of the character (& the other characters). He's simply an aged vet who's just lost his wife and is intolerant to the way the world is heading: pointless gang violence, disrespect to ones elders, neglect for personal and public respect of persons and belongings, etc...and the disconnect that children have with their parents and vice versa....I don't blame him for feeling the way he does about the general decay of our culture...for example the grand daughter showing up at the dead grandmothers funeral baring midrif body piercings, etc..smoking at the wake and rudely making inquiries to his belongings that she might take to college. Hello you rude little brat, ever think about someone other than yourself, especially on the day his wife is being buried? Just a thought. The youth in this are generally portrayed as ignorant, smug, disrespectful, self-important, abusive and vulgar...so Walt (Eastwood) decides to give it right back. I will say this, the infamous line of "get off my lawn" while baring down on the local gang members with a rifle is possibly one of the most memorable moments you'll recall once you see it...because in each of us there is moment, even when a tiny thing has pushed us, where we could go over the edge and after years of it Walt does...and literally says, whatever he pleases regardless of consequence. It's worth owning and watching...Perhaps I did expect a different ending, but the movie is, in whole, going to be equally kin in talent to Eastwood's classics.
Firstly, another Polish positive movie with another portayal of a tough, but deep down caring and always coming through in the end is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008979D">Roommates</a> with Julianne Moore, Peter Falke and D.B. Sweeney. Rocky in Roomates a little different than Walter Kowalski, but like Kowalski, is there for the good and protection of those they care about and need help.<br /><br />Gran Torino is the most touching and moving masterpiece you will ever have the pleasure of viewing.<br /><br />Gran Torino outgrossed, and left all the oscar nominated movies in the dust.<br /><br />Walt, I mean Mr. Kowalski will win your heart and be your new true hero.<br /><br />This movie, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008979D">Roommates</a>, reminds one of the way things used to be: more integrity, caring and credibility.<br /><br />Incredible!!!
This movie is about alot of things but one things for sure, it will make you love it and maybe even make you cry.
Walt Kowalski is a disgruntled widower, a grumpy old man who despises the sedentary lifestyle his children and grandchildren live, who resents the ethnic intrusion into his once all-white neighborhood, who is angry at the God who took his wife away and the priest who tries to comfort him.  Walt just wants to be left alone; his idea of happiness is sitting on the porch with a beer and his dog.<br /><br />But that changes when a Hmong gang enters the neighborhood, hell-bent on recruiting the boy next door.  Walt intervenes, and from then on the neighborhood takes a shine to him, whether he wants them to or not.  It is a relationship that will draw Walt out of his shell...with some funny, emotional, and tragic consequences.<br /><br />GRAN TORINO is spectacular.  It is easily Eastwood's finest directorial piece, and I'm willing to go out on a limb and say it features his best performance to boot.  The flaws here are few and far between; the main flaw is that, in his quest for authenticity, Eastwood hired an all-Hmong supporting cast, many of whom aren't professional actors (and you can tell).  It's a small price to pay, however, for a movie that hits you on all emotional levels: it's funny, suspenseful, and heart-breaking.  There aren't very many emotional punches, thank God, but when they come they are knockouts.  If Eastwood were to stop making films now (and let's pray he doesn't), he could rest easily on the laurels of GRAN TORINO, content in the fact that he has made an American classic (again).
I would highly recommend this movie.  Clint Eastwood plays a man stricken with cancer that has recently lost his wife.  He lives in a harsh neighborhood that is multi-cultural.  There is an hmong family that lives next to him.  The mother has her son, daughter, and mother living with her.  Eastwood plays a very racist, ex-military man that is set in his ways.  He has a good heart but doesn't want anyone to know it.  There is a lot of racial verbage tossed around in the beginning of this show.<br /><br />When the neighbor's son tries to steal Eastwood's character's Gran Torino from his garage in order to become a member of his cousin's gang, Eastwood catches him and makes him do work around his and other neighbors' homes.  The boy is a good kid but was being bullied into joining this gang and really didn't want to.<br /><br />The gang becomes relentless in their attempts to get the boy to join the gang and eventually targets him and his family for refusing them.  Eastwood's character decides to help.<br /><br />It's a wonderful personal growth story on how people can change their views by being around other cultures and understanding them.  Realizing that we all are similar in the most basic ways.  It is also a wonderful stance on the fight against gangs and what they stand for.  How communities can pull together to clean up their neighborhoods and make them safer.
Even after watching Gran Torino for the third time I still believe it's the best film of 2008. It remains the most profound and heartwrenching moviegoing experience I've had with any film of 2008 and, beyond that, it's the rare kind of film that can truly make you laugh while simultaneously packing an emotional wallop. Despite a large box-office take and all sorts of accolades from moviegoers, the film escape any sort of awards for it's elderly leading man and poignant script. The Academy missed a real winner this year.<br /><br />Director Clint Eastwood stars as racist Korea veteran Walt Kowalski. The film opens at the funeral of Walt's wife, where he growls and sneers at the sight of his grandchildren and even his own grown children whom he views as disappointments. As one of his sons comment, "Dad's still living in the '50s."<br /><br />Walt lives in an area of Detroit populated by gangs of various demographics and next door lives a family of Hmong people. Thao (Bee Vang), one of Walt's neighbors, is pressured by a local gang to try and steal Walt's vintage, 1972 Gran Torino. Thao's attempted theft of the car is what, essentially, kickstarts the rest of the film in which Walt reluctantly grows to both like and appreciate the Hmong family next door.<br /><br />This poorly written synopsis sounds like the set-up for a typical movie exploring racism in the 21st century and it's consequences, but Gran Torino is thankfully much more than that.<br /><br />The film has many great scenes; Eastwood's "get off my lawn" line has already been immortalized but it is the lines that follow that are truly memorable. I, unfortunately, am unable to quote them here. Other scenes, like Walt confronting a trio of black men harassing Thao's sister and, of course, the ending come to mind, at least as a way of comparing the way the film balances humor and pathos.<br /><br />The ending packs one hell of a wallop although some people may see it as a sort of anticlimax. I was even disappointed with the ending briefly but it's really the most appropriate way for it to end. It's both beautiful and brilliant.<br /><br />There's nothing elaborate about the film; no showy cinematography, no elaborate set design. It's really a simple movie that is not without it's flaws. The scenes with Walt and Martin the barber (John Carroll Lynch) for example seem unrealistic and serve no real purpose beyond comic relief. As the scenes are quite amusing though, it's only a minor flaw.<br /><br />The other complaint I have is about the acting, particularly by those playing the Hmong characters. Much of it is very unsatisfactory and unconvincing. In fact, many of these actor's almost seem to reading off of far away cue cards.<br /><br />This is balanced out however by Eastwood, who has said this will be his final screen performance. He's a real revelation here. It could be argued that he does little more than growl, sneer, and spit venomous/humorous racial remarks and, yes, he does quite a bit of that. However, besides being very convincing, Eastwood can do more with a growl than some actors can do with an entire Shakespeare soliloquy. Despite the ignorance and overall bigotry of the character, Eastwood makes Walt human, sympathetic, and ultimately lovable. It's not only one of the best male lead performances of 2008, but one of Eastwood's all time greatest performances.<br /><br />Overall, Gran Torino is a great film in the purest sense of the word. You may not agree that it is the single best film of 2008 but you'll be hard-pressed to find a film that will make you laugh and cry equally as hard in a span of less than 2 hours.<br /><br />GRADE: A-
Redemption and compassion rule this Clint Eastwood movie.  I liked that his character broadens his views to see people as they are and when he recognizes the pathos of the gang situation and his new friends, he chooses a path to make the ending of his life worth something.
A wonderful insight into human nature from the worst to the best.  Many surprises throughout, tears will be shed, and no doubt, prejudices will be re-examined from the inside out.  Exquisite film, ignore the physical violence.  It is the violence within the heart that must be dealt with, and it is, quite nicely.  Best Clint Eastwood film I've ever seen.  Rock on, Clint!<br />And I can't get that song out of my head...cruising along the coast highway in 'his' Gran Torino...<br /><br />Perfect condtion from the seller.  Sent in record time.  I gave it as a gift, and it will keep being passed around until there is no more silver left on the dvd...
Perfect example of what pusses gang members are. They cant take on anybody one on one. It has to be five on one. And they have to have a weapon. A really good caring movie. How he knew he was dying so he gave his life to get revenge for the girl. Best Eastwood movie since Unforgiven.
This is a must watch for any Clint fan, or just a great film. They story is exciting and has a wonderful twist. Fantastic direction makes this film in my opinion on of the classic (or soon to be) from a great talent. Nice one!
Last night's bargain-rack movie was Gran Torino starring Clint Eastwood. This one came from the 5-dollar rack at Wall-Mart and was quite a good movie. Of course, I've always liked Clint Eastwood and have a big collection of his movies. In this movie, Eastwood appeared quite old. He played a veteran of the Korean War, and his true age is just about right for the part.<br /><br />Eastwood lived in a decaying part of an older big city. His wife had died and he was now all alone. Most of the original residents of his neighborhood were gone and the new wave of people were mostly Asian. Some Hmung people lived next door, much to his dislike, and the area was plagued with gangs. The "Gran Torino" of the title was for an aging but very-well-kept-up 1972 Pontiac he had stored in his garage. The car was coveted by some of the young hoods of the neighborhood. Eastwood was the old Eastwood and had a few guns and issued a few Eastwood-type threats that kept the hoods at a distance.<br /><br />Eastwood was an aging curmudgeon and angry with seemingly everything in the modern world. Several times he helped the next door family out of threatening situations, for which they were very pleased, and they gradually and grudgingly became friends. Eastwood befriended the young boy and trained him and helped him to get a construction job. It was an uplifting story, probably played over and over in modern America, and well worth watching. Everything about the movie was first rate, but I'd expect that with an Eastwood movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
You know those movies that are even better the second time you see them? This is one of them. The first half of the movie seemed gratuitous and shallow, but as the story progresses, it gets deeper and more meaningful. So by the end, you are deeply immersed and moved. The second time you watch it, you are immersed from the start and notice small things that were shallow and gratuitous the first time round that now have deep meaning. The inclusion of humor (however racist and sometimes hurtful) makes this movie well balanced. I was rotflmao at the barber shop scene. The fact that it looked ad-libbed made it more real for me. Another reviewer said Walt hated everybody. That is right ... not so much a biased racist as a hater of everyone ... even the white kid who was trying to emulate the hommies. He respects hard work, no matter what your race, and I suspect many "racists" are this way and fall for believing in only the stereotypes. I know a few myself. Eastwood is a master film maker and this is one of his best.
I've always enjoyed any movie that Clint Eastwood has appeared in.  This one is definitely one of my favorites.  It accurately reflects the sad situation that this country has allowed to bring upon itself but also shows how friendship exists between different ethnic groups and a supportive nature to each other.  Definitely a good movie to see!!!
One of Clint Eastwood's BEST films, and his least politically-correct (PC) film.  I think there's a correlation.  Another film he did (Letters from Iwo Jima) had its impact & quality definitely damaged by trying to be too PC.  In Gran Torino, Eastwood plays Walt, an old curmugeonly Korean War Vet who's about as least PC as any character I've witnessed in the movies.  He is definitely Old School, he is a retired auto worker, he jokes and curses a lot and he calls everybody by ethnic slurs.  He is growing old and he doesn't fit in with today's society any more.  He is estranged from his yuppie Son's family (his Son sells Toyotas and lives in the suburbs, and his Grandaughter is quite spoiled).  He packs an old 45 handgun to keep himself safe, well, because he lives in Detroit.  Walt's neighborhood is changing into Hmong immigrants and although Walt has quite the initial prejudice against them, he slowly starts accepting them after befriending neighbor Thao (a 18-ish Hmong boy, who initially tried to steal Walt's car after being pressured by a gang but then works for Walt to make up for it).  So Walt gradually feels more attached to his Hmong neighbor children than he does to his own family, and he gets pulled into their lives.  A big part of their lives is avoiding Hmong gangs, and Walt ends up being embroiled in their fight with the local gang.<br /><br />This film works on many levels.  It works on a dramatic level as the viewer identifies with Walt and becomes enmeshed in his life's struggles, as well as Thao's and Thao's sister.  It works on an emotional level as Walt brings out his past demons (from the war) and connects with Thao as if he were his own son.  It also works on a symbolic level, as Walt, the old white American, is slowly going downhill, as he sees his world changing around him, with some good (Asians working hard to rise out of poverty, become doctors etc), some bad (his complacent Son and bratty Granddaughter) and some appalling (Asian, Black and Latino gangs prowling Detroit's mean streets and fomenting violence).  And finally, it works on an acting level, as Eastwood plays a really good cranky old curmugeon!  (BTW Eastwood's son plays a pretty effective bit part as a local white kid trying to act cool in order to escape violence from some local street thugs.)<br /><br />It's yet another in a line of vigilante movies, but more human and involved than, say, Death Wish, and with a powerful dramatic twist at the end.  Being non-PC, it is very effective and does not pull punches.  But it is artistic as well -- the theme song played at the end, written by Eastwood & performed by Jamie Cullem is haunting and beautiful.  I give it only 4 stars because 5 star awards should be rare!
"Gran Torino" is a remarkable film that is difficult to characterize.  Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War veteran who, after seeing combat in Korea, worked on the Ford assembly lines until he retired.  His particular neighborhood has slowly become predominately Vietnamese, and this culture at first neither appeals to him any more than his new neighbors understand him.  Slowly, however, each side comes to appreciate the virtues of the other and therein lies a humorous but also poignant storyline.  Clint Eastwood turns in his usual stellar job as the grouchy, politically-incorrect "Walt".  The big surprise here is that the mostly unknown Vietnamese cast is extremely good and they turn in excellent performances as well.<br /><br />There are some ethnic slurs in this film and normally I do not approve of such.  Perhaps the film could have dispensed with this, but who am I to second-guess Clint Eastwood?  In my opinion this film may be forgiven that, because in the context of this film it is a legitimate device to bring the viewer to the ultimate message of the film, which is one of mutual respect and ultimately, friendship.  Recommended.  RJB.
Gran Torino (2008)<br />Drama, 116 minutes<br />Directed by Clint Eastwood<br />Starring Clint Eastwood, Christopher Carley, Bee Vang and Ahney Her<br /><br />Gran Torino was a total surprise to me when I first viewed it. I had no idea what it might be about and the cover suggested it would be an action movie. With Clint Eastwood being almost 80 years of age at the time, I couldn't see how it would work.<br /><br />It turns out that it isn't an action movie at all. The main themes include age, the loss of a loved one, racism, friendship, family, religion, and personal growth.<br /><br />Walt Kowalsky is a Korean war veteran and one of the last white people in a neighborhood mostly populated by Hmong residents. The film opens with his wife's funeral. He's suddenly friendless and alone, but for the unwanted attention of his two sons and their families, who see him as a burden and wonder what he'll leave them when he dies.<br /><br />The local priest (Carley) promised Walt's wife that he would keep an eye on Walt and try to get him to go to confession. His immediate neighbors annoy him; especially when their boy, Thao (Vang), tries to steal his beloved '72 Gran Torino. To complete Walt's misery, he's coughing up blood and may not have long to live.<br /><br />That all sounds pretty miserable, doesn't it? Despite the grim situation, Gran Torino has a great deal of (intelligent) humor. Walt doesn't pull his punches: he refers to Asians as Gooks and Blacks as Spooks. He tells the persistent priest that he's an "over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promise them eternity." He speaks in grunts and snarls and seems to hate every person he deals with.<br /><br />Walt is a complex character. His neighbors convince him to accept Thao's apology for trying to steal his car by offering the boy's labor for a week. Thao works hard and earns Walt's respect. The two actually develop a friendship of sorts and Walt also likes Thao's sister, Sue (Her). As unlikely as it may seem, from Walt's perspective, he finds that his neighbors are decent people and takes an interest in their lives. He finds that he has more in common with them than his own family.<br /><br />I won't give away any more details, but the story shows how people still have the capacity for change, despite advanced age and a lifetime of behaving in a certain way. The humor is frequent, with Eastwood timing his lines perfectly. At the risk of sounding dramatic, this might just be Eastwood's best acting performance. It's certainly my favorite performance from those that I have seen.

Original review deleted by Amazon, along with 100 other reviews of Gran Torino.<br /><br />Throughout his illustrious acting career, Clint Eastwood has delivered a series of iconic characters, such as The Man with no name, Dirty Harry, Josie Wales, and Will Munny in Unforgiven.<br /><br />Throughout his illustrious directing career he has delivered outstanding movies such as Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby, for which he has won five Academy Awards, for best Picture, Best Director, and including the Irving Thalberg Life Achievement Award.<br /><br />The actors who have worked with him have been blessed with Oscar: Gene Hackman for Unforgiven, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn for Mystic River, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank for Million Dollar Baby.<br /><br />In Gran Torino he both directs and acts, and delivers an acting performance that will be remembered long after the final credits roll, in its unique way, as memorable as any other character he has created.<br /><br />Gran Torino is the second best movie I have seen this year. Not just for the acting, not just for the directing, but for the storytelling, and the emotional journey on which it takes you, the laughter, the feeling of being gripped, and its more surprising moments.<br /><br />In the opening scenes, we have the exposition of the character. We get to know Walt Kowalski, by how people act around him, and his seemingly hateful attitude towards people. More is conveyed through a scowl, and a snarl than with words. When the mischievous grandchildren go through his stuff in the basement, we see the Silver Star he won in Korea. There are three other important symbols in the movie, the lighter, the gun, and the car.<br /><br />We see a hero with a warrior past, a patriot who fought for a cause greater than himself. Clearly, his bigotry stems from those experiences.<br /><br />He's not just mean, he's 'get of my lawn' mean. He's Dirty Harry 'Go ahead punk, make my day!,' mean.<br /><br />His dead wife's priest bugs him to hear his confession, at her request. The priest in a way is his wife's conscience.<br /><br />When he snarls down the barrel of his rifle, at the neighborhood punk: 'I could blow your head off, and sleep like a baby,' you get the sense that he means it.<br /><br />So, with all that happens, we see the change in his decision making, from someone reluctant to be involved in his neighbor's affairs, and a story can turn on something as random as looking at an empty beer cooler.<br /><br />For all his faults, Walt has mature masculine character. Even though he is a difficult father, he has taught his children character. So, when he sees the boy next door lacks character, and a strong male role model, he takes him under his wing, and teaches him how to be a man.<br /><br />The scenes where the boy practises Walt's high octane ball busting banter, are the funniest in the movie. Through knowing Walt, he makes decisions he never would have made by himself. In so doing, Walt finds meaning and purpose, and a chance for redemption, and the boy becomes a man.<br /><br />The Academy's actor awards tend to go to actors in two types of role:<br /><br />1.Psychopath- No Country for Old Men, The Usual Suspects, There Will Be Blood, Training Day, Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />2.Mentally Disabled, Social or Physical Handicap, overcomes great adversity or discrimination- Shine, As Good as It Gets, A Beautiful Mind, Ray, Scent of a Woman, Capote, Philadelphia, The Pianist, A Beautiful Life.<br /><br />Every rule has an exception. Russell Crowe in Gladiator played a character with thematic similarities to Walt.<br /><br />For a 78 year old man to direct and be lead actor in a movie of this caliber is an achievement worthy at the very least of being nominated for the highest award for Acting, Directing or both.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.
It appears this might be eastwood's final staring role in a movie and what a great way to end a long successful career.  Gran Torino has a little of everything to satisfy most movie buffs.  A well written story line with some action, suspense, humor and even maybe a few tears for the soft hearted.  I guess the film touches me personally since I was born and from the Detroit area but brings awareness the issues of gang's in many big metropolitan areas of the country.  As a lone solider, eastwood takes on these gangs with his own brand of justice.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
Gran Torino knocks the viewer off their seat with a hard hitting story that is laced with thumping humour and heartbreaking inspiration. Starring Clint Eastwood, it is the experience of personal loss for all the lead characters in this film, which is a building block for their own greater development. The movie highlights many troubling social dynamics, often with an at times cranky old man's well aimed boot and good heart.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
I am not much of a Clint Eastwood fan but happened<br />to see this at my son's house. Being a Vet I could<br />relate to alot of the stuff in the movie. I had to<br />buy a copy and have watched it many times. It changed<br />my mind about Eastwood and I have alot more respect<br />for him now. Don't be afraid to be a copy!
I saw it in the theatre, and I eventually bought the DVD to watch it later on at my leisure.  I think Walt Kowolski is a typical, grumpy old man, but has a human and humorous side to him.  I love the way he comes around to take the Hmong boy under his wing.  I was sad at the end, but I found myself laughing very often in the movie overall, with Walt's comments and attitude.  Great job Clint Eastwood!
Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video of this Blu-Ray is fantastic.  I didn't see any grain at all.  In fact, even when paused, the video is perfect, and without grain.  I give it 10 out of 10.  This movie must have been recorded digitally, instead of on film.  The audio is great also (Dolby TrueHD 5.1), but don't expect a lot of surround sound, since most of the movie is dialog.  The surround speakers do kick in when appropriate.
The first two-thirds of this I thought were hilarious, though I don't suppose this is intended as a comedy. Clint's gruff old man sneers and wheezes made me laugh repeatedly. He is so miserable that it's comic. He reminds me of Charles Bronson's old 1970s "Death Wish" character, a grizzled man who sets out to take revenge at any cost. Then it slowly morphs into a PC tale about a Hmong gang in Detroit taking shots at a next door family of Hmongs that Clint befriends after first finding them annoying and repulsive. It gets a little violent at times. The Gran Torino of the title is an actual 1972 Ford that was never one of the better cars of its day. Here, because it looks pristine, there is a certain attractive quality to it. This somewhat strange feel-good movie brought an occasional tear, surprisingly.
For Ford fans as well as Clint fans, women and men, a GREAT movie.  You will laugh, cry, get angry, and enjoy every second of it beginning to end.
How can you not like Clint Eastwood?  He is such a talented and gifted actor/director who continues getting better with age. Lets face it, he's no spring chicken and considered by some a little crusty around the edges, but this guy has endured the gift of time. Gran Torino is an excellent movie on many different levels. I am drawn to the movie because my family used to own a gran torino when I started driving. I really loved that car. I am also impressed with the fact that this movie is not "Politically Correct"; of coures I am talking about that term of endearment used in the movie: "Zipperhead". Political Correctness is killing this country. No one in this country can have an opinion or say anything without hurting someones elses feelings. Get a grip people!  This is America where one has freedom of speech.  The founding fathers said nothing about "PC", expressed or implied. I am further drawn to this movie bcause I am a veteran and proudly served this great country. I still remember the oath I took on induction day and how powerful those words were, especially the part about supporting and defending the Constitution of the United States. None the less, if you are one who enjoys well written/performed movie entertainment,blended with today's harsh realities including racial overtones, gang violence, and peer pressure interwoven with a comical yet meaningful bond between an old, slowly dying war veteran and his Southeast Asian neighbors next door, then you will enjoy this movie. By the same token, if you are Politically Correct there is agood chance you will not be able to get past the term Zipperhead, and therefore miss out on a great plot and storyline. This is agreat movie!
This Is probably my Favorite Clint Eastwood directed film. his 3 best In my view are Gran Torino, Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. This movie takes place in Michigan in a highly hmung or oriental populated area of Detroit. Its deeply emotional and will get you involved. It gets into how the cities male demographic go to jail showing they think crime is the only way to get by and some find it cool. It revolves around a pretty biast clint eastwood and his relationship with a neighborhood teen Tao. After Tao steals his car Eastwood or his character Walt takes his offer and makes him work for him. At first walt dislikes tao but they grew into having a friendship. Its a deeply emotional film that requires your full attention. I highly recommened this film to anyone in search of a great movie view, you will not be disapointed. Blu Ray or DVD again go blu ray the picture and sound in hd bring out details in the film that the dvd doesnt and that you wont want to miss. Hope you enjoy the movie as most did i guarentee you atleast enjoy the view if your dont love the movie. Hope this review helped.
Gran Torino shows how two teenaged Hmong immigrants are able to reach a racist Vietnam veteran and change his life, helping him to overcome the anguish he suffered from the war as he saves their lives and the community.
This is a really great movie.  Clint at his best as always.  Language is a little rough if you are sensitive, but extremely appropriate for the mood of the movie.
This is a great movie; a classic Eastwood film.  This film is well done, with excellent acting, and a very relevant storyline.
There is much more to Clint Eastwood than I thought.  It's not just Dirty Harry and 'go ahead and make my day' etc. This was a touching betrayal of a tough guy 'at least on the surface' and some cultural challenges and barriers broken and new friendships and love and compassion and ultimate courage and the ultimate sacrifice and it's very entertaining too boot and loved the ending.  I really loved this movie and hope Clint is around and making and starring in movies for many years to come. I would like to rate this movie higher than 5 stars if more were available.
In Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino, the characters demonstrate cultural boundaries and tension, as well as racism. It<br />also explores the ideas of sacrifice, atonement for sins, and the meaning of life and death, specifically in Walt's character. The film begins by presenting these themes which develop through the plot. Ironically Walt, who continually mumbles racial slurs, transforms due to his growing relationship with his Hmong neighbors. He begins to differentiate between people who have either good or bad intentions, rather than by culture and race.  After the death of Walt's wife, he becomes increasingly distant from his uncaring family. However, he forms a new family with his neighbors despite the negative events surrounding their first encounters with each other. Although the film both begins and concludes with death, there is a focus on the preservation of life during the film. There is even life as a result of the tragic ending. Walt made the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect Thoa and his family from the violent gang. Through this sacrifice he was also able to atone for his sins from his actions during the<br />Korean War. Each character was given what they deserved by the end of the movie.<br /><br />This film effectively portrays the themes while keeping the interest of the viewer. Besides Sue's character, the<br />acting was exceptional. Like the film, the acting was believable and powerful. The film provided insight on the<br />changing racial issues in America today.  It can be appreciated by all mature viewers.
Gran Turino is an action filled movie starring Clint Eastwood. It is about an eldery man who recently loses his wife and finds comfort in the immigrant family next door. In the beginning you may find Walt as just another angry old man but throughout the movie you feel an attachment to him because you understand why he acts like he does. When he young boy next door gets out of hand Walt is pressured into having Thao work for him. After a couple of days Walt gets attached to Thao and his sister. Towards the end Walt makes an extreme decision in honor of the Hmong immigrant family next door.<br /><br />This movie is a must see. Every little thing can be assessed and has meaning from the lighting to arrangement of the houses. I didn't understand why Walt did certain things and I quickly judged him as a grumpy emotionless man. But I really did appreciate him at the end. Whoever directed this movie deserves a standing ovation. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone! Though the language may be inappropriate for children.
Clint Eastwood plays the role of a generation of many Americans.  In their thirties, they might have wanted to hear, "Make My Day" but hopefully in their later years they will hear the message in this movie which is not about vengeance but instead truly asks us as Americans who we consider to be our neighbors (and even who we consider family).  Excellent movie.  Disregard the naysayers and check this one out.
Recently widowed Walt Kowalski is a tough, bad tempered retired autoworker who is estranged from just about everyone in his life. Other than his deceased wife Dorothy, Walt's only other source of affection is his 1972 Gran Torino.<br /><br />Despite Walt's stubborn efforts, his old neighborhood is in decline and under siege by a group of young Hmong thugs. A failed attempt by his neighbor Thao to steal the Gran Torino unwittingly brings Thao and Walt together. Led by his articulate and bright sister Sue, Thao must make amends by working for Walt. This leads somewhat predictably to a friendship. It is, however, the consequences of that friendship that creates the tension and drama of the movie. Clint Eastwood stars and directs this stirring film.
I'm not sure at all why this movie did not make it to a 5 star status instead of 4.5 star.  It was one of the most powerful films I've ever seen and will make you think about it long after watching it.  I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys an intellgent movie with outstanding acting.  This is not either a chick flick or a guy film.  Everyone will enjoy this.
Clint Eastwood's latest film is one of his best ever, as he directs and stars in an updated "Unforgiven"-style drama. The acting is well-done, from Eastwood himself to the other actors. SPOILER!!! The final confrontation scene, while sad, is intense, and at the same time, the only appropriate way for the story to go. SPOILER OVER!!! See it. It's so worth it. Rated R for language.
It just doesn't get any better than this.  A fantastic story and great acting - couldn't be better.
This movie is Clint Eastwoods best. One of the best movies I have ever seen.
From "Go ahead, make my day!" to "Get off my lawn!" this movie is classic Clint Eastwood.
well, I think this is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time<br />It really is one of those movies that really gets you to think a little bit<br /><br />I honestly can relate to this movie as I used to live in the inner city<br /><br />this is basically a combination of a golden fleece movie - where the relationship with the Hmoung family seems to change this man, but it's also a rite of passage - but if I told you more then I'd be giving it away.<br /><br />Honestly I think this is a carefully crafted movie, and for the most part I really think it<br />is really well done.<br /><br />I'm still a little unsure about why they ended it the way they did, but that's for you to watch and find out for yourself.
I have to admit that the Thao character could be a bit better actor. Everyone else did very well--specially the young Asian character Sue. She should keep at it. Eastwood did not have to act more than what he already is as an actor--the rusty, caustic demeanor that is so typical Eastwood. Of course, it's just a movie, so it did take some artistic license; but the human element it tried to show, the story it tried to tell, was shown and told well. The finishing solo by Eastwood was also very good--possibly the most tender part of the movie. I am giving it five stars. For many, it may deserve less than five, but it certainly does not deserve one star like many gave. I suspect people do not want to get close to their soft side, so touching movies may annoy them.<br />Good show. I recommend it.
One of Mr. Eastwood's best. Unfortunately it's also a pretty accurate reflection of Detroit's decay from a once great city.
This movie is a must have for Clint Eastwood fans. You will laugh, cry and go through a wide range of emotions from watching this film.
Take a classic action hero years removed from his action days, a cast of people who have never acted in a movie before, an experienced director and a cleverly plotted and written picture and you get a classic.<br /><br />Gran Torino works on every level.  Eastwood absolutely shines as a old vet and autoworker who has two great pleasures in his life, his wife whose funeral begins the movie and his Gran Torino.  As Detroit changes and falls apart and the neighbors are increasingly Hmong he refuses to move despite all the prompts from his family.<br /><br />Even better than Eastwood's performance is Ahney Her playing Sue Lor the girl next door whose brother becomes both the foe, then the friend of old man Kowalski.  Christopher Carley in his supporting role as the young parish priest also shines.<br /><br />Unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002G1K82Q">Across the Universe</a> you get an actual sense of the cost of violence and war and what it can do to an individual and a community.  It's a movie that actually has meaning.<br /><br />Eastwood's direction isn't pretentious, it doesn't overshadow the message of the film or the purpose of the characters.  It works with the audience instead of preaching to them.  That's why one of the reasons why with a budget 12 million less than Across the Universe it managed to make 300 million more.<br /><br />It's certainly worth $20 more.
This movie deals with some sensitive issues and is not just a good-hearted movie.  It is most definitely a drama with some quirky humor in it.  While watching the movie, we used some of the issues tackled in the movie to open some dialogue.  It is something that we will watch multiple times.
Clint Eastwood directs and takes the lead in this epic story of the diverse cultural mix that our society is made up of today.  The movie has plent of gritty Eastwood humour but is hard hitting and serious at the same time.  This is a must see.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I bought it for my boss for Christmas because he is such a die-hard Eastwood fan.
Gang violence in cultural enclaves or ghettos has gotten pretty<br />much out of hand in many cities where the police have ceased<br />to be any real protection against drive by shootings<br />and rapes. Here an Asian gang in a formerly all white suburb<br />terrorized an young Hmong man and his family.<br />The Gran Torino was pretty much of a failure as a 70's muscle car<br />( much like the Edsel before it),<br />but thirty years later is has become a classic that the old<br />fellow cherishes who has just lost his wife and is himself dying of an<br />advanced lung disease. The young Irish Catholic parish priest is sort of a dead pan<br />comedy relief ( pretty much clueless in the middle of modern decay):<br />these Irish priests show up in Mexican American Catholic churches<br />without a clue about modern life of the communities they are supposed to be serving.<br />The martyr theme here is one that is faulted by the fellow already<br />being on the way to a painful death?
As with almost all Clint Eastwood films, he has again come through with an impactful creation. There is someone in this movie that you can identify with, no matter who you are. Mr. Eastwood solicited people with the right heritage to be his stars. Unknowns and the real deal. That's one reason you can feel the emotions.<br /><br />I rate the film itself a five plus but the high prices for BluRay just make my blood boil. It's the music CD rip off all over again.
A really, really good movie. But why is there no Closed Caption on this download? Eastwood rarely speaks above a gruff whisper, and the other actors (intentionally) have unfamiliar accents. I followed a lot of scenes by continually rewinding.
1.  I'm more a fan of the earlier Clint Eastwood movies.<br /><br />2.  With that being said, I was very pleasantly surprised with the overall excellence of this movie.  It's pretty much top notch from all points of view.<br /><br />3.  Highly recommended.
Incredibly wonderful movie.  Can't go wrong with this one!  Clint Eastwood has never made a bad movie and this is one that I consider to be superb!
I like all Clint Eastwood movies, and this one is no exception.  It had action, suspense, and also touched my heart.
I actually bought this movie for my dad. I heard it was good from many people and so I bought it. In the beginning, the story is somewhat unclear, but just give it a chance, it will get better. I promise! Also, in some parts, I had a hard time hearing Clint Eastwood speaking so I just turned on subtitles and was able to understand the movie better. The movie was worth watching at least once.
I purchased a copy of GRAN TORINO used from Amazon.com.  I used to be a little hesitant in the past but have had only positive experiences.  This purchase was no exception!  Not only was the DVD in perfect condition but the movie was great.  Clint Eastwood is a spectacular actor!  I was surprised at how little actual violence was in the movie - although the language was raw.  This is an all-around A+.
MOVIE WAS GREAT THE VIDEO BROKE UP OR SKIPPED A FEW TIMES OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS FINE
Having appeared in practically every male oriented movie genre in his long career, Clint Eastwood has matured into one of the finest directors and actors the industry - and the public - have seen.<br /><br />  Nearing 80, Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a character of roughly the same age. His wife has just died and Walt is living alone in his home of many years, the last Caucasian in a neighborhood that is suffering severely from "diversity". Kowalski retains the characteristics of the America he grew up in. He is an unrepentant racist, cursing his Hmong neighbors, the Latinos and blacks who, in his eyes, have destroyed his neighborhood. His is a rough camaraderie where "real men" zestfully hurl ethnic insults at each other.<br /><br />  We quickly learn that Kowalski barely speaks with his two grown sons and their families. They have never, it seems, lived up to his expectations. A far too young and callow priest visits Kowalski, urging him to take confession because his late wife wanted him to. Kowalski reacts as you might expect.<br /><br />  The next door neighbors are Hmongs. While Walt smokes his cigarettes and drinks his beer on the front porch, the Hmong grandmother glares at him, muttering insults in Hmong. Eastwood does the same in English.<br /><br />  Kowalski spent three years fighting in Korea and we learn early through the explorations of his obnoxious grandchildren that he has some sort of medal from his service. He returned to work on the Ford assembly line for 50 years.<br /><br />  Now he is alone. Old and alone. He has only his smokes, his beer and Jim Beam, his dog Daisy and his 1972 Ford Grand Torino.<br /><br />  Next door live the Hmong family with two Americanized children, Sue, a girl in her later teens and Thao, who is something of a momma's boy. A Hmong gang wants Thao to join and isn't very gentle in its persuasion.<br /><br />  Kowalski, belying his years, rescues Thao once and then his sister Sue, establishing himself as a hero in a neighborhood held hostage to the gangs.<br /><br />  A reluctant friendship grows between Kowalski and the Hmong, particularly with the young Thao, to whom he becomes a mentor.<br /><br />  Dramatic events pile up quickly and Kowalksi is clearly on a path with his destiny in his dreary Detroit suburb.<br /><br />  Eastwood directed this magnificent film and his acting is superb. He has Kowalski's character down pat. Others may see the resonance between "Gran Torino" and John Wayne's last two films. Eastwood is aware of his aging and he plays the part as if it were real - perhaps because it is.<br /><br />  I was uncomfortable with some parts, perhaps because it seemed to give up too much to "diversity" and "multi-culturalism" without asking some obvious questions. But I certainly can't fault the movie for that.<br /><br />  In its own way, this film is as great as "The Unforgiven", not so much for the story (which is good) but because of Eastwood's direction and acting. He milks this story for all that it is worth - and that is a compliment.<br /><br />Jerry
This was bought for Fathers day, my fiancee has been wanting to see it ever since it came out in theaters. He was very happy with it
I liked most of the movie, but my wife will not even watch it. Storyline not appropriate for young viewers.
Beautifully executed film about forgiveness and redemption.  Wry Eastwood wryly wins my heart in this, fabulous story, acting, casting.  Keep going, Mr. Eastwood, your vintage is at its best!
This movie is one of the best of Clint Eastwood. Beautiful message on human sacrifice; understanding and foregiveness.
This was an excellent movie with a surprise sad ending. It held my interest the whole way through. There were funny parts also. Just an enjoyable movie
This has been, personally, my favorite movie of the Millenium, so far! Im glad to add it to my collection - the viewing of this recently bought DVD is (our) fourth time watching it. Great story, brings out a mix of every emotion, fabulous acting, no wasted space or time!
this is an awesome movie,<br />it reminded me of my father to a tea!
This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. A modern day tale of life on the streets and the choices that people need to make in order to survive. Clint Eastwood is at his best in this movie.
I got this for my y, and expected it to come after his birthday but showed up before. He loved it, thank you very much
You still got it, Clint. An Awesome movie with a nod to Dirty Harry, albeit an evolved one. A beautiful movie about mercy, redemption, and salvation. This movie has got heart.
This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be! It had a great storyline, good message, some funny moments, and some heart-breaking moments. Clint Eastwood was awesome as Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran who is very cranky, grumpy, and racist. He lives in a neighborhood dominated by poor Asian immigrants and infested with gangs. A young Hmong boy named Thao Lor who agrees to an initiation which requires him to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino, but Walt stops him. Walt finally befriends Thao's family, and tries to help Thao become a man, and learn responsibility. When a Hmong gang threatens the Lor family, Walt knows what he must do. I highly recommend GRAN TORINO!!!
I watched most of his films, and even reruns of Rawhide. The only thing I ever really liked was his early 70's movie "Play Misty for Me," where he showed some emotion other than rage. I know some of his more recent films like "Million Dollar Baby" were more well rounded, but I was already too turned off by the gratuitous violence of his earlier films; but he always was, and is, his own man.<br />But shockingly to me, Gran Torino brought Clint, and his career, to a much more conciliatory, and ironically peaceful. higher ground through his enlightening encounter with Hmong culture.<br /><br />Prior to seeing GT, I had read a book on the Hmong culture, Anne Fadiman's "The Spirit Catches You and You all Fall down."  They had been an independent ethnic thorn in the side to the Han Chinese dynasties for centuries, before being forced to migrate to the highlands of Laos. During the Vietnam War they were offered various trinkets by the US military invaders to aid them in that awful war. Well,(General) Westmoreland and his cronies, as they often did with their imperialist insensitive inhumanity, did not keep their word and the Hmongs were bombed out of the Laotian highland home- they had always been mountain people. Well to make a long and gruesome story short, these proud people were exiled to the total alien, via squalid refugee camps, American Culture. One family ended up as neighbors of the aged Dirty Harry like character played by Eastwood in a bombed out Detroit, which was symbolically not all that dissimilar to the war ravaged Laos the Huongs were forced to leave.<br /><br />We initially see the Eastwood character (Walt Kowalski, Kowalski was the name of the pre-eminent "wrastler." Killer Kowalsi, of the 1950's) left alone with his only contact being with his vulturistic, superficial children, and his memories of Korea and his recently deceased wife. Then the "gooks" (the Hmongs) moved next store. Initially Kawalski sees his Hmong neighbors as another assault on the world  of his past, when Detroit, Ford and GM were great. However, we slowly start to see similarities between Kowalski and his Hmong neighbors, who both were exiles from an earlier more triumphant  time, and both were trying to hang on to their crumbling cultural identities. At first, Kowalski, in his usual hard ass (Eastwood) fashion rejects the friendly overtures of his neighbors, but soon he succumbs to their charm, honesty, innocence and authenticity. He becomes a protector and mentor to his neighbors and their children- particularly against the Hmong male gangs that were destroying their American born son. These conflicts were interspersed with moments of humor (e.g.,the thank you party for his protecting them). The transition comes full circle in the final scene when Kowalski doesn't "bring his guns to town," with his hardened heart being opened by his encounters with his proud and humble neighbors. It certainly did, as Dirty Harry once said, "make my day."<br /><br />This film can be viewed on many levels. It is a story of a man accepting change and diversity at an age when most people would prefer to dwell on their memories. On a more profound level, Gran Torino suggests the possibility of global unification, or at least respect, of diverse cultures and an unconditional acceptance of "the other," no matter how different they seem on the surface. This was definitely the movie of the year. Moreover, in my opinion, this is Eastwood's most socially conscious and finest film; as Elvis Costello once sang, and this could have been part of the soundtrack ,"What's so funny bout peace, love, and understanding?"
Clint Eastwood is so often seen as just Dirty Harry that we often don't see that he is quietly become one of the best directors of the past 25 years.  Gran Torino is a touching and subtle film that evokes such basic human feelings that you can't help but pay full attention and become absorbed into it. The characters are so basically human that you can see them in so many different settings.<br /><br />Among the most refreshing aspects of this is how Eastwood's character, an unabashed racist, SOB, doesn't really change so much as evolve. What we see originally as racism is really more a case of a fellow who believes in protecting one's own and that is exactly what he does here. Eastwood deserves credit for giving himself the candor, humor and humanity to play a real human being and not fall into a caricature. I have to say this is the film that should have won for best picture!
I remember Clint Eastwood from tv on RAWHIDE at the start of his career.  I remember him in a musical western PAINT YOUR WAGON in 1969.  I remember him in all of those westerns plus his first foray as DIRTY HARRY.  I remember his getting fired from the studio he worked for as a tv star, not for bad behavior but for lack of talent.  I was one of those same stupid people back then that thought this guy was just coasting on his good looks and as soon as those were gone his career would be kaput.<br /><br />Well his good looks are gone but he has so much talent that he is bigger than ever as both a director and actor.  Having seen the Oscar winner, Sean Penn in MILK, recently, I really think it should have gone to Eastwood instead.  Not that Penn doesn't do his usual first class job.  No, it is that Eastwood inhabits every nuance of a truly original fictional character which I tend to appreciate a lot more than biography.  Further, Eastwood hits America right where all the people in it live emotionally and economically in this moment of time whereas MILK looked back to a brief shining moment in gay rights history in San Francisco.<br /><br />Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old recent widower and Korean Korean War veteran.  He is a retired auto worker in Detroit who still lives in his old neighborhood much to his family's consternation.  His proudest possession is his completely restored 1972 Gran Torino automobile.  The attempted theft of this auto by the Asian youth who lives next door sets off a richly nuanced relationship between the two, which slowly ripens into a friendship.  They each have their separate problems too.  Walt is hitting the end of the road medically as he coughs up blood and discovers his serious prognosis.  The youth and his family are being terrorized by an Asian gang to which his cousin belongs.  They want him to join them and when he won't, they ratchet up the violence towards the entire family.  We know how Dirty Harry would solve the problems in this movie.  Walt is not Dirty Harry.  He lives in the real world and has to find real world solutions to the problems before him.<br /><br />Eastwood is just wonderful as this character.  The movie itself is a fine piece of writing which Eastwood himself superbly directs.  Such a fuss was made about his CHANGELING (which he directed with Jolie in the lead), which came out in the same year.  Now that I've seen both, this is the better movie. The Walt character is just everything you've got to love long range about America and what we are so close to losing.  It's true.  They don't make them like Walt anymore.<br /><br />Eastwood himself closes the movie by singing in his Walt voice a song about his Gran Torino over the closing credits. Here, truly, is the man who has done it all.
There's not many Hmong-American movies out there. I think this DVD has a lot of heart, a great anti-gang message, and demonstrate the evolution of a racist mentality to enlightenment.
By my reckoning (and as of this writing), this is Clint Eastwood's third masterpiece as a director and star.<br /><br />The first two were "Unforgiven" and "Million Dollar Baby".<br /><br />What's Clint's secret to making such outstanding films?<br /><br />Simple -- he doesn't give a fig for what some studio suits think will be commercial.  Instead he looks for a good script.<br /><br />The script for "Gran Torino", like U and MDB, is simply impeccable.  Yes, it's filled with vulgarity and racist language such as you may never have heard onscreen, but that doesn't diminish its command of story and character.<br /><br />The truth is, I wasn't very keen to see this movie when I saw the commercials.  Ho hum, Clint playing another crusty old codger.<br /><br />But then I saw an available copy of GT at my local Redbox kiosk and took it home.<br /><br />Like MDB, the film gets under your skin, and it had me bawling like a baby through the last half hour and crying some more the next day.<br /><br />To say this film is surprising and deeply moving is an understatement.  If you like great movies, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.<br /><br />I have deducted one star just because of the paucity of special features on the DVD -- no director's commentary, no behind-the-scenes making-the-film featurette, just some stuff about cars.<br /><br />I hope that this deficiency will be rectified soon with a better Collector's Edition...  The film certainly deserves deluxe treatment.
the movie was excellent,clint eastwood was his dirty harry type,with the neighors and with he gangs.i good movie to see that like clint eastwood he is still very good in his later days
Eastwood, in his senior years still writes great stories and perfourms soft action roles in his own movies, WOW. Great gangster, suspense movie with a emotional twisted at the end. Carries a military idea of "leave no man behind"
This is an awesome movie and I recommend it to everyone. However, if you're planning to buy the Blu-Ray version, you better make sure you have a BRAND NEW Blu-Ray player.  It will NOT play on older players.  Those that are so old that they do not have the ability to upgrade the firmware will probably NEVER be able to play this movie. I guess it's some kind of copy protection crap, but I'm getting sick and tired of modern technology that doesn't work properly.  This movie deserves better.
As a retired Marine, I've met my fair share of characters like Walt Kowalski, convincingly represented  in this movie by Clint Eastwood.<br />I have to say he did an incredible job of being this individual, considering I've just co-authored a book with Betty Dravis who actually interviewed Clint Eastwood and her recollection of him is nothing like the character he portrays.<br /><br />There are a variety of things this movie addresses and I wasn't honestly prepared for it to be as good as it is.<br /><br />In addition to Clint's realistic performance, I was especially touched by the feisty "sister" of the character Walt begrudgingly begins to like. She not only holds her own, but then some!  The brother character took a while to grow on me but grow he did, and the one gang member (can't recall his name) who "flipped Walt off" was also very convincing.  My oldest son and I both laughed at the things he said because his character reminded us--and I imagine will remind a lot of people--of people like that, that they know or have known.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Clint for years now, and it isn't a matter of whether he still has IT! He definitely does!  This movie is a MUST SEE and an eye-opener for those that aren't aware of this very real world.<br /><br />This movie couldn't be more aptly named because of all the people on the planet, (and having traveled a bit of it), I would have to say that Americans have the most "mad love" for cars!<br /><br />The barber is also an integral part of making this movie work, but you'll have to see it to see why I say that.<br /><br />Last, I watched this by myself because no one was home at the time I bought it, then again with my wife and son, and I have to say, it was even better, the second time around because there were subtle things that got by me the first time. I enjoyed it much the first time, as well! It's the kind of movie I'll watch many times through the years.<br /><br />Chase Von<br /><br />Co-author of Dream Reachers with Betty Dravis
I thought this was an excellent movie, and I agree with the reviewer that stated this was Eastwood at his best.  It is a movie that combines humor and seriousness in wonderful mixture, examining the realities of prejudice, but ultimately showing how those realities can be altered and overcome.  Eastwood is at his gruff best, while at the same time ultimately showing his humanity and selflessness.  My daughters and I thought this movie was simply great!
I am so sick of every race other than the 'horrible white man' complaining of racism when they live in America. Frankly, present yourself as a respectible person and you will be treated as such. Clint Eastwood was fantastic!
This is a fantastic example of a Clint Eastwood movie. No need for special effects to keep  you interested, just a great story told in a great way.
Gran Torino is BRILLIANT...<br /><br />at least watch it once.... funny, and clever...<br /><br />Clint proves he is a genius....<br /><br />5 stars... watch it!!
My last name is a long Polish word which translates into "parsley" in English.  Eastwood's acting and directing is flawless.  Walt Kowalski, as Clint portrays him, reflects quite accurately just what my father's and uncles' (old-fashioned) Polish characters were very much like. We also had Italian in-laws in the family... and the exchange of verbiage, during family get-togethers, was a lot like that which occurred between Walt and his barber in the movie.<br />  The movie does reveal a marvelous fluidity of Walt's character; Walt does drop much of his ingrained structures of prejudice, at times... and this change from prejudice to compassion is very bright and sunny.  Humanity can change from rigid perspectives to more insightful and compassionate intelligence.<br />  As an aging man, I could relate to Walt's sagacious reflections and physical ailments and problems.  My favorite philosopher, J.Krishnamurti (who lived part of each year in Ojai, California), when he was alive, was very appreciative of many of Clint's films; Krishnamurti died at the age of 91.  He would have relished Grand Torino, with its perceptions beyond organized religion and its probing into flowering insight/compassion, i'm sure!
This was a movie that takes you by surprise with its simple beauty. You won't find plot twists, intrigue or CGI effects. What you will find are unvarnished truths presented in the form of a simple tale. The acting is subtle and understated, and doesn't call attention to itself. These characters are real people dealing with everyday realities that we can all relate to or at least recognize. But the magic occurs when Eastwood's grouchy, slur-slinging bigot and his new Hmong neighbors manage, accidentally, to meet in the middle of an immense divide to find that, at bottom, they're more alike than either might have imagined. It is a testament to Eastwood's skilled direction that this unlikely friendship appears to form naturally and easily, never forced.<br /><br />The final scene of redemption took me totally by surprise and is a sly commentary on Eastwood's many tough guy movies. Eastwood appears to be telling us that self-sacrifice and caring for others are the highest acts of courage, things which can never be found in the barrel of a gun.<br /><br />This movie is elegiac testament to the directorial powers of a true master. The fact that it didn't get an Oscar says more about the Academy than this movie.
It's my understanding that Clint Eastwood intends to "hang up his spurs" as far as acting goes. Not that anyone could possibly blame him. This film the best I've seen in quite some time. Other reviewers talked about the bigotry but I see it more as diversity & cultural misunderstanding & how it can be overcome given the opportunity. It also shows that our country is changing rapidly & will probably never be the same.<br /><br />I learned a lot about the Hmong people that I wasn't aware of before, it even made me do a little more research about them. They are an amazing culture. I like the fact that most of the actors were native Hmong which gave the film a sense of realism, as well as the fact that it was filmed "on location" as opposed to Hollywood. All of the casting was superior.<br /><br />I have noticed a lot of thinly veiled references to many of Mr. Eastwood's prior films in this one which I found very amusing. I'd swear that "Daisy" is the same dog from "Outlaw Josey Wales" (gladly he didn't spit on her head - but the scene with Grandma was priceless!) The relationship with Grandma seemed familiar (even though she didn't speak English) to Granny from "Outlaw" (mutual tolerance). There was also some "tobacco-spitting" included). It seemed like some of the character from "Heartbreak Ridge" was in Walt, just maybe later in life. There might have been a small amount of "Dirty Harry" in there as well. Watch it & I think you'll see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Even though there is a lot of sadness in this film, there is also an abundance of classic humor as well. The way Walt used "Toad" to pay back his "debt" was priceless ("wasp nest, now that's terrible")! The barbershop scene was also great!<br /><br />The scene in the basement (during the party) begs the question: What does it say about our society when an 80 year old terminally ill man has to level a dryer when there is a room full of young able bodied young men watching him do it? Where will we be when there aren't any more "Walt's" left?<br /><br />This film also depicts a lot of the problems that our own culture has (family interaction, etc.) It was really disgusting the way that Walt's family treated him but sadly it's too commonplace these days.<br /><br />Every time I watch this film it makes me sad that it will most likely be the last time we'll see Mr. Eastwood in front of the camera... Every time I watch the movie I feel that he's trying to tell us something more (about himself personally?).  If you are a are a fan of Mr. Eastwood (or even if you're not) this is a "Must See" movie... I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!
I rarely write reviews; I just tend to read them and most are quite helpful. I'm writing this for two reasons: to comment on some of the negative "reviews" here and to share my thoughts and feelings about Gran Torino, which may be Clint Eastwood's last movie.<br /><br />Last night it was late and I still wasn't tired at all, so I went to my DVD collection and Gran Torino practically jumped into my hands. I put it in and before I started to watch it (for the 6th time in the last 3 weeks), something told me to read the reviews at Amazon. After perusing through all 252 comments I was amazed at the people who gave negative reviews. The most used comment was "wooden acting".<br /><br />My brother, who studied cinema and is a screenwriter, and I (and I studied film as well) talked about that very same comment that so-called professional critics leveled at the movie. We laughed at that because of two reasons: we grew up near a lot of Asian people and if they don't know you they are VERY withdrawn and may seem a bit... well, wooden. So Clint was being true to life with the portrayal of the Hmong people.<br /><br />The other thing that made us laugh is that Clint Eastwood is meticulous and thorough when he does pre-prep for any movie, especially one he plans to direct and act in. His work ethic allows him to be spontaneous behind and in front of the camera. And the "critics" didn't even notice that he purposely shot this film with a grainy stock, almost to make it have the look of a student film or a documentary. He intended to give the look and feel of Gran Torino the same sense of immediacy and uncertainty Walt Kowalski feels. Why else start with a funeral, followed by the experience we the audience have of seeing him alone in a house filled with so-called family ?<br /><br />We're intended to feel his unease and sense of aloneness as well. And at the same time, next door, a child is being blessed: death and aloneness at his house while new birth and renewal of life is just next door... although he doesn't know it at the time while we do.<br /><br />One last note about the negative commentors: I noticed that they tended to be very short, like one sentence or two, whereas the people who liked/loved the movie wrote some really detailed comments on what the movie meant to them. Not one negative comment gave a detailed account of why they didn't like the movie. It seems they just got on the "wooden acting" bandwagon. Perhaps they may be relying on he "crituque" of so-called critics they'd either read or seen on TV.<br /><br />I've been watching a lot of Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford movies lately. I've just been really drawn to them. I feel that they had similar careers, in that that they were perceived at first as nothing more than pretty boys- eye candy for the box office. But they both were very serious about their craft and became very masterful along the way. Both learned the basics and became excellent actors, directors and story-tellers. And both have created some of the best American cinema since the 1970s.<br /><br />What I love about both (for some reason they seem very much the same in that they let expression and subtleties express SO much more than words ever could) is that they are major stars and icons in our culture but they were mostly focused on their craft. So we have the benefit of a very rich legacy of cinema to learn from. And their movies are so fun to watch the lessons are effortlessly learned. Now that's magic, to me.<br /><br />As a musician, writer and hopefully one day, a screenwriter as well, I cannot even think of a better place to start than with movies from Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford. "Less Is More" is a sometimes over-used and misunderstood adage. With them, they make that saying sing like Maria Callas at her peak. They've taught me that economy can equal depth, as well as a VERY important thing: get the audience engaged and thinking. They've showed me, in movie after brilliant movie- just how much you can get from that simple yet difficult to master concept.<br /><br />Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's summation of his career, his limning the interstices of his place as an icon in cinema and yet another treatise on the art of "Less Is More". I first saw it in the theatre, the first time in years I'd even had the desire to go see a movie. I was a bit shocked at the graininess of the film stock at first but then I understood what he was doing. Just like in Unforgiven he used shadow to express light, here he was using graininess to express the very refined craft of making a film. And, as I wrote earlier- that grain gives a sense of immediacy, almost as if he couldn't wait to say, "Action !" and roll film.<br /><br />He sends up Dirty Harry ("Get OFF my lawn") and the Outlaw Josey Wales (the first time he has that what turns out to be a spitting contest of sorts with the Hmong grandmother, who's spit is more potent than his, was hilarious). Those two characters redefined modern cinema. With Dirty Harry, an entire genre of movies wouldn't have been as rich as they became; The Outlaw Josey Wales brought the Western back to prominence in modern cinema.<br /><br />While embodying these mythic characters on film he always knew his role in becoming an icon and understood the larger implications. So, while sending them up he also adds a great degree of pathos to Harry Callahan and Josey Wales. He's studying them along with us and adding more depth and richness to them. What a brilliant technique !<br /><br />With Gran Torino we are watching a master seemingly effortlessly and quite playfully display his work for us to see just what it takes to make great art. And he gives a very eloquent summation of his iconic impact on modern cinema. And besides that- it's a great film. Popcorn, please !<br /><br />This movie clearly shows he wasn't just a pretty boy. There was a great artist always inside.
A local talk show host here in Bakersfield (Ralph Bailey), who happens to be an African American, and a moderate conservative, often says something to the affect of "Folks born before WWII get a pass for saying "knucklehead" racial epitaphs because they lived through the era of segregation an the Civil Rights movement. However, those of us born in or after the "Baby Boom" should have learned better by now. We had the benefit of growing up watching shows like "All in the Family", and "Sanford & Son" to poke vicious satire at bigoted thinking, and so we hope at least to have moved on.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is a great film that gives us some great lessons in dramatic form. Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a man from that earlier generation and he throws epithets out without ever thinking there is anything wrong with it. He hits white ethnicities as much as he does people of color, and it was weird for me to remember that there was a time when speaking like that was common.<br /><br />But here's the thing, Walt is a good man, prejudiced perhaps but still a good man. Walt is forced to consider his racism when he unwillingly gets to know his neighbors. When he asks his young lady neighbor why her people came to America, she explains that her people (the Hmong), fought in alliance with the USA in the Vietnam war, and when America quit, they left the Hmong high and dry, and would be slaughtered if they stayed behind. It seemed to me to click a connection in Walt's brain, then he began the friendship that became closer than family to him.<br /><br />In "Gran Torino", Eastwood continues to swing his message away from violent solutions in his films. This is probably my favorite after the "Unforgiven", of Eastwood's films promoting this message. It is a thoughtful, well written, well acted and well directed film. That really surprised me in the end.<br /><br />One of the best films I've seen in a while!<br /><br />5*<br /><br />Now there is a missed opportunity however, not with the film, but rather with the DVD, There was a great chance to do some documentary work on the change of demographics in American Culture as well as a specific opportunity for some history about the role of the Hmong in the Viet Nam War. Instead there are some rather banal pieces about America's love affair with the Automobile. My first car was a '73 Gran Torino, so if anyone should have liked what they did, it might have been me, but I seldom watch DVD extras, and I still think they missed a great chance to do some more good with this excellent movie.
I won't go into too much detail because so many others have written how good this movie is. ONE OF CLINT'S BEST! I'm so disappointed it was snubbed for an oscar.  EXCELLENT! A MUST SEE!
I think this movie is destined to be a classic.  They say that fine wine gets better with age, and that definitely applies to Clint Eastwood in "Gran Torino."  The story is compelling -- it kept me up way past my bedtime because I had to know what happened next.  That's one way to know you're in the hands of a master storyteller.  Another way to know the same thing is when the ending comes as a complete surprise which, in retrospect, is totally inevitable --- and profoundly moving.<br /><br />This movie jumped immediately into my top ten favorites of all time, and I think it may be the best thing Eastwood has ever done.
I grew up on Eastwood.  My parents are huge fans; they actually saw The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in the theater 3 times when dating.  I can name every movie just off the music Eastwood was in.  When seeing the previews for this movie, I knew I'd have to have this one.  Everyone has told me this movie is no disappointment; the previews were very thrilling.  I did expect more action, however, the friendship that forms between the crotchety Walt and Thao is heartwarming.<br /><br />Walt is a war veteran, very racist, unhappy, mean, and in need of a friend; someone to care about who cares about him.  When he chases the local gang off his lawn saving Thao's hide, Thao is indebted to him and begins to work for him.  Through this they become friends.  Walt's family is nothing but greedy and distant.  Walt soon saves Thao's sister from punks and instantly makes a friend out of her.<br /><br />The movie is about the car but isn't.  Everyone wants that car, but only the one deserving will get it in the end.  My mother warned me the ending was not what I'd expect and boy was she right.  I knew there would be death on both sides, but I just didn't know how that would come about.  I did cry my eyeballs out at the sacrifice and the friendship shown.<br /><br />This was an excellent movie, you must watch and own.  Truly an Eastwood best.  Imagine Dirty Harry old and meaner and you have Walt.  This movie is now one of my favorites, right up there with Sudden Impact, The Good The Bad and the Ugly, High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, For a Few Dollars More, A Fistfull of Dollars, just to name a few of Eastwood's movies that will never grow old.
I got this movie on a whim, in part because I am tired of seeing Americans turning into either fat blobs or pussies afraid of their own shadow (or worse, self-righteous morons who really think government is the answer to everything.<br /><br />Eastwood might hate the comparison, but this is a collage that goes well beyond <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800179501">The Karate Kid</a> meets <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000YTP02">Secondhand Lions (New Line Platinum Series)</a>.<br /><br />It most assuredly is right up there with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JVUHY">Million Dollar Baby (Full Screen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731959">Absolute Power</a>.<br /><br />It's hard to sum up this movie so I will say just three things:<br /><br />1.  He weaves every possible American hard-ass self-made man image in as gracefully as it could be done.<br /><br />2.  He does for the hill people of Viet-Nam what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094AS9U">Bride and Prejudice</a> did for India but without the music, love, and dance.<br /><br />3.  The ending is spectacular--Eastwood's voice in the background, slow singing against a visual as the Gran Torino drives toward the future with its special passenger who inherited from the master.  For this alone I would rent or buy the DVD.
What a solid movie and solid performance by Clint Eastwood.  This is a gripping tale of family greed, racism, and ultimately self sacrifice that will stay on your mind for a while.  It is a movie where people move past a layer of racism and embrace each other for who they are.  Sometimes the people that you grow up hating the most are actually more like you than your family.  This is a must watch movie that grips you from the beginning and leaves you satisfied at the end.
Eastwood did it again.  With all his anamosisty toward forigners, he<br />wasn't afraid to learn a lesson in American behavior.  Being retired Navy,<br />I learned my lessons many years ago.  This movie is his greatest.
clint has done it again. this  movie should be watched by people of all races it teaches a good lesson on racism.
Spoilers.....<br /><br />Many parts of this story are hard to watch--there's a brutal Hmong gang which does terrible things even to their leader's own family members.  The subject matter is very provocative, as it pertains to a crusty old Korean war veteran who must learn to live with his Hmong neighbors in the deteriorating suburbs of a Michigan city.  A young man is burned with a cigarette, and his sister is gang-raped.  It ends up in a showdown between Eastwood and the dangerous and deadly gang.<br />There is no easy way out of this mess and no clear-cut solution. This is why I call it fearless.  There is no totally happy ending here where everyone finally learns to get along and live happily ever after.  Thank goodness--we get too much of that dreck already.<br />It's not easy viewing, but it is worth consideration.
Amazon, why won't you post my review? What is wrong with Amazon?<br />Excellent movie and Blu-Ray.
Clint Eastwood has done it again.<br /><br />His swan song???<br /><br />A good film dealing with many social & personal issues during a lifetime.<br /><br />A very trans-generational movie!!!
This movie had everything you'd ever want in a story.  Humor, drama, real-life terror situations, you name it.  An amazing ending to an amazing story.

Huge home run.  Movie is humorous, tough, and tender at the same time. Brilliant script.  Eastwood hits all the right notes.  A story with character that isn't totally PC, but certainly sends the right message veiled in a devil may care heroine.  There isn't a wasted scene in the movie.  If the language puts people off, they never spent much time with their grandfather or great uncle.  Much less about rascism or violence than I expected and firmly focused on love, loss, and purpose.  Easily one of the year's best movies.
On Christmas Day, Gran Torino opened in limited release. After our Chinese dinner, we headed to the lone theater in Metro Detroit showing the film. It was then and later on Blu Ray, a masterpiece! I love many of Eastwood's films, but GT has to be my favorite! I won't bore with details, just wanted to add my five stars to the mix!
This movie doesn't end like you would expect from a clint eastwood film, but then again what movie is expected from clint eastwood. Huim and his son do a great job in the creation of this film. It really touches on interracial barries, as well as moral lessons in honosty and integrity. This like most clint eastwood directed films has great acting, and a good story line. He does a good job creating a dark image of himself.
I have to write this this way, because this is how I saw it.<br /><br />My dad got four medals while he was in Korea: the UN/Korean, the Bronze Star, another one I can't remember, and the one he was most proud of: the Distinguished Flying Cross. That's 70+ successful combat missions.<br /><br />My dad had a stroke in 2005. He now has advanced dementia. He doesn't remember who he used to be. When I started watching this movie, I started crying because just like the Jack Nicholson charater in a "A Few God Men," it was like seeing my father the way he was...not the way he is now, with advanced dementia, who can't remember anything but his childhood and his 20 years in the Marines.<br /><br />I wish my dad could go the way that Walt Kowalski did in this movie. He'd have appreciated it...if he could remember how and what, anyway.<br /><br />I'm only 36. I understood the main character as soon as I saw him, because he was in Korea duing the Korean War. Dad would've done the same thing.<br /><br />I like the movie.
XXXXX<br /><br />"A Mexican, a Jew, and a coloured guy walk into a bar.  The bartender looks up and says, 'Get the [common vulgar word] out of here!'"<br /><br />The above "joke" is said by this movie's main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood, who also directed and produced this movie.)<br /><br />This story follows Walt, a recently widowed Korean War veteran who is alienated from his family and angry at the world.  Walt's young Hmong American neighbour Thao (or "Toad" as Walt calls him) tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Torino (or, more specifically, a Ford Grand Torino Sport Sports Roof) on a dare from his cousin for initiation into a gang.  Walt develops a close relationship with the boy and his older sister.  The gang does something to the older sister and Walt vows revenge declaring that "They won't stand a chance [against me]."<br /><br />(Hmong or Mong Americans are residents of the U.S. who are of ethnic Hmong decent.  Indigenous Hmong are specifically from the mountainous regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma. The Hmong are also one of the subgroups of Miao ethnicity in Southern China.)<br /><br />Despite the movie's deceptive simplicity, it evolves into something complex, powerful, and even tender.<br /><br />For those who like lots of mindless action in their movies, this movie can become tedious.  However, those with patience will be rewarded by this movie's end.<br /><br />This movie marked Eastwood's return to leading actor status after four years (his previous leading role was in the movie "Million Dollar Baby").  The then 78-year old delivers a superb performance in what he has said is his final film as an actor.<br /><br />Eastwood can make "Get off my lawn" (while aiming an M-1 rifle) sound as menacing as Dirty Harry's "Make my day."  When he says, "I'll blow a hole in your face and [then] sleep like a baby," he sounds as if he means it.<br /><br />Beware that despite some moments, Walt's toughness is more verbal than physical.<br /><br />This movie features a large Hmong American cast.  Even though the actor who played Thao (Bee Vang) and the actress who play his older sister (Ahney Her) had no previous acting experience, they hold their own with Eastwood and give convincing performances.<br /><br />(Note that Eastwood's young son, Scott, also has a small part in this movie.)<br /><br />The song in the movie titled "Gran Torino" was nominated for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song.  This music was a collaborative effort of four people that included Clint Eastwood (who sings briefly during the end credits) and his oldest son, Kyle Eastwood, who wrote the music.<br /><br />This movie was recognized as one of the ten best films of 2008.  Eastwood's performance gained recognition winning "Best Actor" from the National Board of Review.  As well, this movie has grossed almost ten times more than what it cost to make.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is simply a remarkable movie.  I leave you with what Walt says to a young priest, the priest who presided over his wife's funeral:<br /><br />"I think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life."<br /><br />(2008;  1 hr, 55 min;  wide screen, 29 scenes;  rated 'R')<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX
The incisive reviews for this film are numerous, and I remove my hat to them. For the interested dvd-buyer, I have a few words. Also, I wish to speak to the cinematic merit of this film.<br /><br />Being an Eastwood fan since "Paint Your Wagon", and a veteran watcher of his spaghetti Westerns, Eastwood can do no wrong by me. As a director/producer, his seminal work on jazz musician Thelonious Monk in "Straight, No Chaser" will stand as hugely in the future as "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil".<br /><br />"Gran Torino", in my view, does not meet the standards of the two abovementioned films. In the still-lambent light of "Million Dollar Baby", it is a rather trivial little thing. What strikes me most is that you will love this beginning to end if you love Eastwood; otherwise you might think you just been had by yet another overblown after-school-special-type flick.<br /><br />Still, I have to admit no one could do this sort of thing except Eastwood. No one would have the balls, no one would have the talent or the know-how. This brings me to ask, "Why didn't Eastwood make this film better?"<br /><br />I know there are intense comments in other reviews about how great this is as a statement about racism...somehow I wonder if Eastwood really meant it exactly that way. After all, the story IS about him, a crusty, nasty old Korean War vet with a big guilt complex about "killing gooks". It is always all about him. Perhaps this film is more geared toward the way we change our prejudices. I know the character reminded me of myself--perhaps that's why I'm one of the few who's NOT raving about the movie.<br /><br />Take this review as-is. It isn't in my purview to tell you to avoid the film: I say buy it and watch it 100 times--Eastwood deserves that much, and it is worth watching at the end of the day. Cinematically, it's as perfect as one can get: the cinematography is gorgeous considering the setting. Finally, I'd take a cue from this movie and study up on the Hmong Tribe, very important real-life people living in this country.
Saw this one in the theater.  Clint Eastwood is a kinda older Dirty Harry persona, with a little bit of Archie Bunker in him--he is not a policeman this time.  He is actually a retired car salesman and former soldier.  The movie begins at his wife's funeral.  He stands in the church, assessing his relatives.  They are just not up to his expectations (granddaughter with piercings and belly hanging out, etc.).  Clint is definitely a character.  He tells it like it is and has a biting sarcastic way of doing it.  He saw his share of "action" as a Korean War veteran, and is not afraid to stand up to people.  He has guns, too.  Clint has a Hmong (Vietnamese) family living next to him and they become part of the story line, as they eventually become friends.  Clint also stands up to gangbangers and tries to help some neighborhood folks out.  There is also a young, baby-faced Catholic priest that pesters the heck out of Clint because Clint's wife had asked the priest to look after Clint before she went to the other side.  I cannot tell you anymore without ruining the story for you, but it is a great storyline with fine acting.  And you know Clint is one of those actors that can say more than words with just a look. It was a very enjoyable movie.<br /><br />By the way, Grand Torino is a restored Ford.  I think they said 1962-- a beautiful car that Clint's character restored in the movie.
A very heart warming movie by Clint and all whom are in it.  Alot of emotions from me. Watch it, you'll like it.
GREAT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY, WELL YES I DO IT'S SO TRUE. IN SO MANY WAYS, THE [...]GRANDAUGHTER ASKING FOR THE CAR EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS DISRESPECTFUL TO THE EXTREME. THE NEIGHBORHOOD BEING IN A CONSTANT STATE OF DISREPAIR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE HOUSE. I WEEP FOR THIS COUNTRY. THIS MOVIE SPELLS OUT SO MANY THINGS THAT WE WON'T OR DON'T WANT TO RECONIZE. SOME OF YOU WILL RIP ON MY CONSTANT SPELLING ERRORS AS A WAY TO DISTRACT YOU FROM THE TRUTH BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING. THE MAIN CHARACTER WHILE FLAWED SHOWED ME, IF NOT ALL WHO SAW THIS MOVIE HOW FLAWED AND SHALLOW OUR LIVES HAVE BECOME, THANK YOU CLINT EASTWOOD AND BRAVO.
A fantastic movie, touching and appealing in so many ways. One of the best I have seen in a while, and its another example of Eastwoods amazing talent both in front of and behind the camera. I have to say he is in many ways among the greatest ever in Hollywood.
This movie was GREAT!  We bought it and gave it to my boyfriend's father who was in Korea.  He reminds us of Clint in the movie.
This is a great movie. We enjoyed it and the service from Amazon was great!
As stated, this movie develops the few characters in it in a creative and interesting way. This movie isn't for any audience. It is filled with offensive and hate-filled comments, so if that bothers you, maybe you should look into something more dolled up by Hollywood.<br /><br />Although longer than I expected, the movie moves at a decent pace. Parts seem too long at times, but they are all necessary for development of the characters and the plot.
This is literally the first time i've taken the time to write a review about a film.<br /><br />The plot is not original. The cast are all unknowns, and the racism is rampant..<br /><br />With that said....  I LOVED THIS FILM.<br /><br />As many of you have already written, Clint Eastwood and crew deserve all the recognition and notoriety after creating this moving film..<br /><br />My only critique would be the flagrant use of derogatory terms. But, in hindsight, it ultimately does build to the story of when they start becoming friends and the climax of the movie shifts towards Walt's act of redemption..<br /><br />To me, this film is masterfully woven together.<br />You didn't know if he was going to die from the diagnosis he received,<br />or if he was plotting to go out with guns blazing (dirty harry now driving a gran torino...) Anyone can see from a mile away that he was planning on that night being his final breathe, but, I never would have imagined his selfless act of sacrifice.<br /><br />Obviously, he's going to the house to seek vengeance for their actions.. But, in a way, I got the sense that his redemption from the korean war was to be killed by those gooks... almost an eye for an eye kind of thing..<br /><br />But at any rate, those are just some of MY interpretations of the film.<br />I hope you take the time to view the film, and take it for what it leaves you with..
I gave this moving a 4 because at least the first half of the movie is slow but when it gets going it is a very good movie.  I do not think this is one of our favorite movies but it is a good movie.
Clint Eastwood's performance is what you'd expect.  We enjoyed the film and it's message even with it's flaws. Eastwood's politically incorrect lines were hilarious at times.  Not many filmmakers would have the nerve to use such bigoted language today.<br /><br />It is definitely better than 90% of the movies recently released on DVD.
I have enjoyed most all of Clint Eastwood's movies whether he's the actor, director, or writer.  He is, with Woody Allen, one of the two best contemporary American directors.  He is also the John Wayne of our times.  Eastwood gets credit for exploring the soul (and the society the poor soul lives in) in a manner that leaves us with a lot to think about.  In "Gran Torino" Eastwood tackles the issue of prejudice by showing how a man beyond repair can still come to see the light.<br /><br />The opening of the film tells us all in a few short scenes; elderly widower, unhappy with the world, uncommunicative with his well-meaning sons and their families, staying in a community that "changed" into one where he is alone in isolation.  A man whose major life-changing event was the Korean War where he killed Asian enemies who, in turn, had killed his American buddies, he looks out around his Detroit neighborhood and finds himself surrounded by Asians who are, in this case, Hmong refugees.  Either way they are just Asians to him.  Now, all alone after the death of his wife, what is there for him other than his mint condition Gran Torino.<br /><br />Obviously this movie creates a series of events that gets Eastwood off his front porch and involves him with his neighbors.  (Otherwise this would be a pretty boring film).  The manner in which things happen are presented in a believable manner.  The metamorphisis we see happening before us may seen a bit sudden at times but we'll just let that pass as the handiwork of the local (and youthful) priest.  Cultures and generations are heading for a collision and the results leave us with a bittersweet taste.  Heroism takes many forms and we get to observe one form not often portrayed these days.  Given the clerical involvement it may be fair to suggest a few Biblical parallels but I'll let you decide for yourself.<br /><br />I missed seeing this movie on the big screen.  It was in town just a short while and I heard mixed reviews about it.  I can see where some might not care for the ending and I have struggled with a 4 star or a 5 star rating.  I decided on 4 stars by rating "Gran Torino" against other recent Eastwood pictures.  It's not a "family picture" but it is certainly worth seeing.
We rented this movie this week and the sound was so quiet, we couldn't even watch it! We turned up the TV as loud as it could go (far too loud for anything else we were watching) and still missed a lot of dialogue. The checkout attendant at Blockbuster had the same problem. So did our friend from Texas who came to visit.<br /><br />You can make it work if you have your TV hooked up to a sound system that can crank up the volume, but if you are watching it on just a TV set, you won't be able to hear much.<br /><br />If you get this movie, buy a stereo system to go with it.
This story line has been used many times.  It's basically the good-guy vs. gang-bangers with a kid torn between which path to take.  I like Clint East wood as an actor and as a driector. (Who doesn't?)<br /><br />There's some really humerous dialog when Clint is teaching the boy to "Man up" and late in the movie.  The interacial interations and slurs left me laughing out loud.<br /><br />The ending was spoiled a little to early in my opinion.<br /><br />Useless fact: My first car was a 1974 Gran Torino.
Clint Eastwood has been a marvelous filmmaker throughout his entire career, and he continues to amaze us with his range and deep artistry.  He has also one of the most prolific filmmakers around, and in 2008 he made two features.  Whereas many directors in Hollywood can take years between films, Clint cranks them out with ease.  He's done this a lot in his career (1997, 1975 for instance), and here, the two films, Changeling and Gran Torino, are excellent.<br /><br />Gran Torino is the better of Clint's 2008 films.<br /><br />This may turn out to be one of my favorite Clint movies, as it's a real surprise of a film.  It's funny, sad, tragic, uplifting, and fascinating, and Clint packs it all into a running time of two hours (it's shorter than most of his other films, which usually hit the 140 minute mark). Clint gives one of his most memorable performances as Walt Kowalski, a retired auto worker living in the Midwest who is a racist.  Through circumstance, he befriends one of his neighbors, a Hmong teenager, and helps him through his life, leading to a stunning conclusion, one of the most surprising and moving in all of Clint's work.<br /><br />This is one of Clint's most surprising films, funny and tender, filled with great cimenatography, funny dialogue (much of which is very un-PC, but it totally fits the story), intelligent situations, and, for the most part, excellent performances.  The two lead Hmong actors overact on occasion, but all of the other performances are first rate. The film is also very respectful of the Hmong culture itself, and I myself knew nothing about it until this film.  This film is also the biggest box office hit of Eastwood's career, which is really wonderful and a bit startling, if you think about it.  When I saw it in the theater, the show had sold out!  I can't remember the last time that happened (lucky for me, the theater added another show an hour later, so I didn't have to wait too long).  It reminds me of when Bob Dylan's Modern Times hit #1 a couple of years ago (and his recent album, Together Through Life, hit #1 as well).  Years ago who would have guessed that Eastwood would have a #1 hit in 2009, especially when you consider most, if not all, his contemporaries are playing caricatures of themselves, are doing mediocre supporting roles, or rehashing old roles.<br /><br />It was a crime that Eastwood didn't get major Oscar nominations for this film (or Changeling, except for Jolie).  I have always wondered what goes through the mind of Academy voters when they nominate and award mediocre films (like this year's Slumdog Millionare, a decent film but hardly a great motion picture), and shut out much more thought provoking, challenging, and entertaining films like Gran Torino.  This film has been compared to Paul Haggis's Crash, but in a way that shows Gran Torino is the far superior film about race relations.  Crash is a bloated, self important, and preachy film.  Most people agree that Gran Torino manages to say more about race relations and tolerance than the ridiculously PC, overblown film Crash (ironically enough, Paul Haggis wrote several films for Clint Eastwood, all of which are better than Crash).  Methinks that the Academy is jealous of Clint, in that he's first an artist, and a celebrity second, and he just makes great films.  He should have gotten something for this film.<br /><br />Eastwood keeps surprising us and himself, making excellent picture after excellent picture.  His last six films, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Changeling, and Gran Torino, have been a remarkable run, and I can't wait for the next Clint Eastwood film.
Clint Eastwood gives us a multi-layered gem that some may find contrived and clich&eacute;d, but under the hood of this slick and powerful film lies an all too truthful look at what our world has become!<br /><br />The film is gripping from the opening credits to the very end and even though at times it seems a little heavy handed, it's blatant truth is really the film's genius. Apparently, Clint Eastwood can do no wrong, as I can't see anyone else getting away with this film. It's really a wonderful piece of work that speaks volumes about the world we live in.<br /><br />The film is full of wry wit and I laughed through much of this entertaining, but sad film. At times I couldn't help, but think of Dirty Harry and like the Duke in 'The Shootest' this film seems like a beautiful tribute to one of our most endeared actors. This film is not just a shinning classic muscle car, but a dark and deep drama that echoes the reality of our world today.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this "in your face" look at our sadly deteriorating society and also a film that doesn't apologize for using "politically incorrect" language. Of course we learn that you can't judge a book by it's cover and that stereotyping is unfair and wrong, but it's a part of society and it shouldn't be swept under the rug.<br /><br />I can only hope some spineless moron in charge of content for films released on DVD will not alter this film years from now.(Yes Disney I'm referring to you!)<br /><br />The DVD has a very good transfer, but the extras are disappointing on this single disc edition.
Ok, it starts out with cranky,old Clint Eastwood's character. The begining is basically the part where it shows why he is all grumpy and has that hoarse smoker's voice. It is somewhat about the car because how the confilct against the Hmong gang all started was because of the car. One of the Hmong boys got got and was forced to work for Clint Eastwood's character. They began to bond with eachother and they began to like eachother. The boys sister was beaten and raped and then Eastwood's character decided to go out and finish his deed. If you are into those dramatic/sad stories and movies, or just any type of genre I would most definitley reccomend this to everybody out there!
Awesome movie. Clint is my hero. After his performance at the RNC, he is even more my hero now than ever.
Another great Clint Eastwood movie! This one will tickle your funny bone and bring a tear to your eye as it takes your emotions for a ride, very good acting, character development and depth, something lacking in 95% of movies nowadays.
The movie is amazing.... but I absolutly hate that stupid frame it plays in.... you are better off going to redbox or buying it..... or just downloading it!!!!! IDK why i didn't do that in the first place.
To Miami Nights in response to your post.<br /><br /> The greatest part of this movie is not only the idea of love and equality, but also the simple idea that change is possible if you embrace it. This movie had me crying, laughing, and angry which is all cause and effect of a great movie. Everyone should see this movie no matter where you come from or who you are. It portrays life the way it really is without holding back. Who enjoys watching a movie when we all know the ending, or what's going to happen next? We love and hate true ending stories because most of them we know that it has to be done, but we can't bear to think that its going to actually be done. We as people naturally want to feel happy but as most of us know all to well tragedy is just as much a part of life as happiness. It is good that at the end of the movie they didn't have Walt do a complete 360 change and start loving all Hmong people, and become this completely self righteous man because in real life things just don't happen like that. Its good they showed how he developed a relationship with them but still kept most of his beliefs. This movie should have won awards regardless of the films first time actors sometimes they care more about how the movie is going then big name actors. It's always good to see a movie with a good message use first time actors it can help us connect better with the characters and it helps them get their names out there and maybe start a career themselves in the movie business. Regardless of the fact this movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and it will continue to rain in my heart for years. This is a true to life story and will bring many to emotions to anyone who watches it. The fact that Walt can adapt and develop a relationship with those he despises the most is remarkable. It's ironic how the story's plays out as well. In the beginning Thao tries to steal Walt's 1972 Gran Torino which is how there relationship begins and at the end when Walt dies he gives his two things in life he cares about most to Thao his dog daisy and the 1972 Gran Torino. Its almost angelic at the end of the movie when Thao is driving the Gran Torino with daisy down the shore drive, and you hear Walt also known as Clint Eastwood singing the song called "Gran Torino," making his presence known it gave me goose bumps.<br /> I would like to point out that Asian Americans are just as present today and have their own society, gangs, and even communities around the country. Most of them go unnoticed and some people don't even realize they exist, but they are here and they aren't going anywhere. It's very good that somebody took the time to shine the light on them and to show people that they are here. America is the biggest melting pot of any country and everyone has a right to be here to try and make a better living. Asian Americans are everyday people and deserve to be known as such. The stereotypes given to Asian Americans mainly come from movies that portray them wrongly, and hopefully because of Clint Eastwood more people will try to represent them more accurately. This was by far my favorite Clint Eastwood's best movie and its one of his best movies he has ever not only played a role in but directed as well. We all love Dirty Harry and Million Dollar Baby and the rest of his movies, but as far as the message he was trying to send with this particular movie it has hit home to a lot of people. There are two very important messages in this movie. The first one is love and care for those people in your life because life is too short and will pass you buy, and the second message is work hard and good things will come to you don't take the easy way out.
I had to have this movie.  Clint is a great actor hands down.  You feel for the main character.  You are grabbed at the very start of the movie.  You feel for every character.  Every time I see this movie at the end I cry.  Clint looks almost identical to my late grandfather and acted like him too (very stern).  At the end of the movie, every time, I cry.  There are many funny moments in the movie too.  This movie is to build the main character to be a relative or friend of yours, for a very understandable reason.  You'll just have to see the movie to understand.
In Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood, at 78, once again directed himself.  This is his best film.  The Gran Torino is an automobile and prized possession that retired Detroit autoworker Walt Kowalski helped assemble.  Eastwood, as Walt, is a cantankerous, racist, beer-chugging  Korean vet who keeps his shotgun ready to lock and load.  Walt is like a retired Dirty Harry, except the Dirty Harry part is still on the job, a sort of security guard of his property.  When gangs begin to threaten his neighbors, Walt's duties expand and he begins to notice that he has more in common with those he called "gooks" and "chinks" than his own sons and grandchildren.  He becomes a tough-love surrogate father to Sue and Thao, the two teenage Hmong next door.  The film is both funny and moving.  A treat not to miss.
Made me think a lot of my dad. I would recommend to anyone.<br />Clint Eastwood gives a wonderful performance as always.
Perfect flint eastwood film! Has action and good dualities wig a great storyline! I like how it is filnmed in the Detroit are!
great film... but quality of picture was very poor... it would intermittently stop, restream, buffer, then start ... this happened throughout the entire movie... I continued to watch only because the movie was so good that I wanted to finish watching it through to the end... makes me skeptical to order a film via amazon again
I love this movie. I have watched it over and over! Clint Eastwood still has it!!! It does have crude language but the message is clear. You can change you view of a culture if you get to know the people that make up that culture.
I ordered and received this DVD movie.<br /><br />The movie was a good price and in perfect shape.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase.
Excellent movie.  Clint Eastwood has a magnificent performance.  Good blend of drama, action, compassion, philosophy.  Good story line of forgiveness, reconciliation.  Clint kept me in stitches with his witty one-line zingers.  Two thumbs way up!! :D
I generally don't like Clint Eastwood movies, but I loved this one.  It is a very good story of an elderly man who befriends his Hmong neighbors.  It is this movie that impresses me of how great of a director Eastwood is!
Loved this video. His best yet Shows both the hard and soft side of the character. A compelling story of overcoming the temptations of taking the easy way out.
This is a great movie to show Hmong culture and the role gangs play.  It also depicts the generational struggles that occur in families.
This might be one of the best movies ever made.  I can watch this movie over and over again.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood does a excellent job in this movie.
Clint Eastwood has done some of his best work over the last twenty years. I just seen this film for a second time and was moved again by its depth of insight, profound character development, along with Clint's profound interpretation of the character of Walt. This performance was an Oscar caliber rendition in my view.<br /><br />Eastwood's Directing also brings sensitivity to the characters and the issues they face in a social context of gang violence in the hood.<br /><br />This film is a humanistic tour de force and only enhances the gruff character portrayal Eastwood delivers as protagonist.<br /><br />The relationship between Eastwood and Tau is the major theme of the film and it tells a contemporary  story of the mentorship of a wise (if overly gruff) man who leads a young man in to the ways of the world, but additionally, tells us that care and concern for marginalized populations is an act of great courage.<br /><br />In my opinion, Eastwood is a Master Filmmaker of the highest caliber.
Great movie.  My husband and I both liked it really well.  Lots of action and keeps your attention.
(spoilers in this review)Gran Torino is a movie about a racist Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski played by Clint Eastwood. In movie opens and closes with a funeral. The first one being Walt's wife's, where we learn that the members of his family are spoiled and selfish. Walt is living in the fifties, although his neighborhood is very different from what it was back then. Hmong people have moved in all around him. And being that he is racist he doesn't really like this not only because they are Hmong but also because they can't seem to keep up their yards or houses. One night someone tries to steal his prized Gran Torino that he helped build in the ford factory. Walt comes after them with his other prized possession his rifle. Later he find out it was his neighbor Thao's gang initiation, after spending a considerable amount of time with Thao and his family. By the end of the movie Walt becomes close with Thao, his sister Su and the rest of the family except Grandma. And because of Walt trying to protect them from the Hmong gang the family suffers the repercussions. Thao wants revenge for the gang hurting his family but Walt will not allow this. Walt sacrifices his life in order to give Thao and Su a chance in life. Because with the gang in the neighborhood Walt believed they had no chance.<br /> I would give this movie five stars, I loved it. I think the movie did a great job in painting Walt's family in a negative way. I know their portrayal made me hate them in the first few minutes, which helped me understand some of the reason why Walt was miserable. I think audiences will appreciate the humor although it's very vulgar, and will be touched by the act of love and selflessness that is Walt's sacrifice for Thao and Su.
good movie we enjoyed it there really is not much to say about this movie that all the other reviewers have not already said will watch it again.
Loved seeing this movie in the theaters, and though I bought it as a gift for my significant other, I'm sure I'll be watching it too!  It was a great deal, can't beat it.
This is an awesome movie. Clint gives an awesome performance. It is obvious that time has just made him a better actor. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a Clint Eastwood fan, or anyone who enjoys a good story line. My wife is not a big Clint Eastwood fan and even she loved this movie.
Arrived in perfect condition. Thanks. Bought this as a Christmas gift and I was very pleased with the fast shipping
Shipped quickly. Great quality. Very happy with the price. Item arrived as described and in a timely manner. We love this movie!
The detail about the movie was upfront before I purchased it, so I know that it was rated R and not for the very young. I have viewed it before my purchase so I new what the movie was about. Love the movie and the price,the seller was great on the price and the delivery of my purchase I would buy more movies from this seller. Very happy
Really a movie that sucks you in, as you feel for the old man played by Clint Eastwood, and the family that is his blood that doesn't seem to understand him, with the family next door that embraces him. It was wonderful sharing difference of nationalities, generations, and life in general.
This movie will keep your attention as most Eastwood movies do.  It is so sad that the movie portrays what does go on<br />in our large cities.  I don't like the street language but it is realistic which is sad.  Watch it !
This is one of Clint's best movies by far. He brings back the "walk softly and carry a big stick" mentality that our country once had. His character reminds me of my dad who happens to be a vietnam veteran, still smoking and cussing lol.
I have seen this movie many times and it is one of my favorites. I was very please with the company who shipped it. They shipped very quickly.
Excellent movie.  Bought it after seeing it on network TV and wasn't disappointed.  What the network omitted due to time or rating constraints changed the movie enough that it is a must to see the original version.  Movie arrived within the specified time stated.
I am bias...love Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and director.<br /><br />Gran Torino touches on the sensitive subject of prejudice.  The movie is so well done I got the feeling I was a fly on the wall watching real-life change happen in a neighborhood in transition...from working blue collar white america to mixed races with a growing gang violence influence.<br /><br />I have grown up in a very safe protective community...and is hard to imagine hoods like the one shown in this movie, but I know they exist.  The ending of this movie is realistic and a bit shocking.<br /><br />I really enjoy this movie.  The pace is perfect...allowing enough time to really get to know Clints character.<br /><br />Hope this review helps.
The grouchy lapsed Catholic (Clint Eastwood) is living his retirement, with his pet dog and his endless supply of beer, manicuring his lawn, doing odd jobs in his house and watching the world go by from his porch. The world is changing and he is not. An ethnic minority (in Korea) extended family are now his neighbours. He growls at them often, particularly when his lawn is touched by unwelcome encroachers. His pride though, apart from his stoic independence, both from his neighbours and his persistent young priest, is his car; a Gran Torino. Funny bits are when he exchanges badinage with his barber. For those who haven't seen the film, any descriptions that follow would give the plot away. Let's just say that it comes to an emotional crescendo; indeed, with an ultimate gesture to love. It's a great film, so great that it's now in my top ten!<br /><br />Ian Hunter.<br />Author of `e-Love'.
THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE SEEN BY EVERYONE IF FOR NOTHING ELSE THAN THE LINE,  "THAT OLD HAG HATES MY ASS".
Good movie Ok shipping, but thats fine this will be a christmas gift for my dad who has never seen this movie before.
Synopsis: Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a bitter, aging Archie Bunker-like Korean War veteran and widower who seems to hate just about everybody and everything. That is with the exception of his '72 Gran Torino. When he finds himself pulled into a gang related situation terrorizing his Asian neighbors he finds himself invested and connected to others for the first time since the death of his wife and reevaluates his life and what he should do to better things for the neighborhood.<br /><br />Critique: 'Gran Torino' is a hard hitting contemporary drama that mirrors many of the attitudes and social problems plaquing American urban society; loneliness, ignorance, racism, uninvolvement, hostility and gang violence to name a few. Clint Eastwood delivers one of his best film performances (my personal favorite is 'Pale Rider'). The dialogue is sharp and bitting, the storyline edgy and contemporary and the acting is honest and believable. This is hard-hitting cinema that is both enjoyable and meaningful. Recommended viewing.
I saw Clint tell an interviewer that he believed this movie will be his last acting job, that there are no more interesting parts for him to play at his advanced age. Debatable, but nonetheless GRAN TORINO will be remembered as among Clint's greatest films. It has a wealth of strengths to recommend it:<br /><br />*There is the interesting plot dealing with the two primary characters. Kowalski, the gun-toting, bigoted, foul-tempered, codger<br />  neighbor softens some while the weak teen-aged Asian boy next door hardens some. The development of their relationship is<br />  wonderful.<br />*The displays of the Asian neighbors' ways are fascinating.<br />*For fans of Clint's toughness displays there's that, too. In fact Clint is still quite believable at age 78 sticking guns into<br />  villain's faces and stomping people into the ground!<br />*The film contains racism, but don't let that keep you from seeing it. The racism is presented tastefully to define the main character.<br />*I challenge anyone to get through the ending without shedding tears: it's that touching and sad.<br /><br />GRAN TORINO is very impressive, especially when you consider that many of the cast's younger members weren't even actors! Clint also directed this one, and again he earned his regard as one of Hollywood's best directors. With a small budget he put together a hell of a movie that covers relationships, racism, gang crime, comedy, excitement, and death.
East Wood in his latest film strikes gold portraying a old retired loner who is tough and grizzled he quickly develops a soft side and becomes sort of a gentle giant and mentor to a troubled youth who is a neighbour. Very good film
The guy can do anything extremely well.  The many hats he wears in this business has proven that.<br />Despite the tragic loss of Walt, the story was good and left an important message.  You can always count on Clint to never disappoint.
Both my husband and I LOVED this movie!  The story line is great and as always, Clint Eastwood was awesome!  Please take my word for it, the movie is WELL WORTH WATCHING!!! ;)
Clint Eastwood portrays Walt, an average everyday retired auto worker & a veteran of the Korean war.  He lives in a run-down section of Detroit (please pardon my redundancy!).  Walt is a crotchety old hermit who would like everyone to believe that he is cold & heartless.  Just one problem:  in spite of a rough exterior, Walt has a heart of gold!<br /><br />At his wife's funeral he finds that his two sons & their families are selfish & narcissistic.  They only care for Walt insofar as the property they will inherit from him after he passes away.  Not exactly solace for a man who has worked hard all of his life!<br /><br />Juxtaposed with his self-centered family are Oriental neighbors who live around Walt.  After inadvertently rescuing a young man from the attack of a gang, Walt becomes something of a hero to his neighbors.  Unlike his own family, who could care less about him, the racist retired Ford worker finds them to be eternally thankful to them, and much more gracious than his own family would  ever dream of being.<br /><br />This is the outline of the film.  In some ways, it is a little bit like a raw, violent, downtown Detroit version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ASOC">Finding Forrester</a>.  To be sure, the thugs in the film are unreasonable in every way ~ straight out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012XIGXC">Gangland: The Complete Season One</a>.  They're not much in the brains department, but their anarchist approach to life makes them scary dudes.<br /><br />One of the more remarkable things about this movie is just how ordinary all of the characters are.  These are people all of us have dealt with in our everyday lives ~ both good & bad.  There are no supermodel actresses in the film, & there is no lush scenery.  It's just Clint Eastwood and the drab scenery of the city of Detroit (I've been there myself, and it's hardly a scenic locale).  These aspects are not a negative of the movie, but rather they just drive-home how much the film depicts the life of everyday personas.<br /><br />I swear that Clint Eastwood's scowl is every bit as much of a cinematic icon as the starship Enterprise, Andie MacDowell's smile, "shaken, not stirred" & "I'll be back."  Clint is about the only thespian I know of who can wear a frown on his face the entire movie and still(!) portray a likeable character.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of Clint's, this instant-classic is a must-see.  For myself, this is my very favorite CE movie.  If you're not a big fan of his style, this DVD just might compel you to change your mind about the big fella!
The main character evolved and learn to appreciate the differences among people , i cried at the end of the movie, best movie i have seen a in  long time and i  have seen many and rarely buy movies , will buy this one
I've been a long time fan of Eastwood's and I can honestly say that this is amongst my favorites. It is certainly much more satisfying than "Million Dollar Baby" at least in my book and definitely above "Bloodwork". It's not "Unforgiven" or "Dirty Harry". All of those to varying degrees were escapist fodder. Escaping into the old west or the streets of San Francisco can be pleasurable. "Gran Torino" has moments that harkens back to William Money or Harry Callahan but only moments. Those are probably the moments seen in the previews. This movie surprised me with its combination of drama and humor and compassion in dealing with sensitive subjects like aging, death, racism, religion and a re-evaluation of a person's values; to come to peace with inner demons that have tormented someone and finding peace within one's self. The characters flawed enough so that there is no preachy message here or anything and doesn't pretend to be some sensitive film about any of it's subject, but instead deals with them rather harshly actually.<br />There is plenty of humor to be found herein as Walt Kowalski, Polish-American veteran of the Korean War, retired auto plant worker and now a widower faces the change of having to deal with things changing in his life. Kowalski never misses a chance to get in a racial slur and even as his son drives away after the wife's funeral, Kowalski noticing the make of the son's vehicle mutters," Why can't you buy American?" and inside the vehicle the son Mitch's comments are about the predictability of dad's racist outlook on things. And speaking of racism there is a heavy dose of this elsewhere as well.<br />Walt's neighbors are Hmong people whose son is harassed by a group of thugs wanting to initiate him into their gang so as to protect him from a rival Mexican gang. Thao Vang Lor is assigned the task of stealing Kowalski's prize possession from his days at the Ford plant, a mint condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino. Thao botches his assignment and the gang show up to give Thao a second chance. When he refuses that gang becomes violent and Kowalski is awakened by the shouts and the sounds of yard ornaments being knocked over and broken. Walt armed with his shotgun isn't afraid of the gang or their "f" word vocabulary. The gang backs off and retreats and Walt becomes an unwilling hero to the Hmong's whether he likes it or not. Only Thao and his sister, Su speak any English so Walt is unable to communicate to the other relatives that he just wanted to left alone. After being smothered with flowers and trays of Hmong delicacies, Thao's mother, Vu forces Thao to confess to Walt about his attempted car theft. Su, translating for Vu explains that Thao must atone for his deed by working for Walt. Walt reluctantly becomes sort of father figure to Thao even getting him a job in construction and loaning him tools, but Thao's cousin from the street gang and friends have other ideas and brutally beat Thao one day while heading home from work. Su also is rescued from some black thugs by Walt and expresses her gratitude by making Walt a regular dinner guest. Meanwhile, Walt goes after one of the gang the beat up Thao and leaves him beaten and bruised with a warning to leave Thao alone. The gang retaliates, opening fire on the front of the Vang Lor's house with automatic weapons, and beating and raping Su.<br />The end has Walt finally coming to terms with his racism and other demons. Thao assumes that Walt will go after the gang for what they did to Su and that he will be along for the ride. Walt forbids this and locks him in the basement. The end is a fatal shoot out with Walt as the victim and the gang is placed under arrest.<br />The gist of this is that Walt has never told anyone that he was dying of tuberculosis. He is seen visiting a clinic and coughing up blood on several occasions. He dies for a cause and settles his demons regarding the things he did in the war which have haunted him all of his life and are the underlying reason for his bitterness. He resents being a hero for things he didn't want to do in the first place. This may seem a bit contrived but it flows well and ties up all of the loose ends nice and neatly and even gives you some things to think about as well.<br />This isn't the greatest movie that Eastwood has ever done. But it may serve as the final chapter in all of those "aged" character movies that he's been putting out since "Unforgiven. The aging gunfighter(Unforgiven), aging thief (Absolute Power), aging news reporter (True Crime), aging secret service agent (In The Line of Fire) and so forth. This seems to be sort of the culmination and final chapter of that series of movies the same common thread. This, however, does deserve a place amongst Eastwood's best and most original movies.
Theres a moral to this story, a strong moral.  For me, Eastwood is superb.  The supporting cast, whilst not seemingly professional (a lot of them) do what is necessary and needed.  Its the story of a bigot, a racist, a rigid man who doesn't like 'people' probably because of his trauma from the Korean war.  But his heart is touched and he resolves and addresses both his and many others' problems.  Watch it as a film, for entertainment and then, watch it again, and see to underlying message.  Wonderful film, wonder music.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
I enjoy Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director, and i was personally pleased with his film. The co-stars were definitely not as great, but Clint makes up for that. I also really liked the plot, and the roles of all the actors. The whole movie came together well, Clint's racy comments are both funny and somewhat predictable, but none the less awesome. There is even some good action scenes in the film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good movie, or the big movie buff.
`Gran Torino' is quite simply one of the best films I have seen in quite some time. Directed by, produced by and starring Clint Eastwood, this film has a feeling of gravitas and meaning from the word go. This follows Walt Kowalski, who is a Korean war veteran, and how has he seen the neighbourhood around him change over the years and how he has seen a rise in violence and intimidation. It also looks at how he faces his own prejudices about his Hmong neighbours and strikes a relationship with the family next door. It is touching to see Walt develop from the archetype grumpy old man, to seeing someone with a softer side and with a great deal of compassion for those who are in a worse situation than himself. Clint plays Walt gruff and old school from the outset and you often laugh at his up front honesty, especially when confronted with a do-good catholic priest, but he isn't a one trick pony and manages to show his considerable acting (and directing) skills throughout. This may be Clint's swansong film, but considering the calibre of films he is making at the moment it would be a great shame if that was so. This has a powerful ending that will resonate long after the credits have rolled and will have you coming back to it in your mind at odd times in the days after you watch the film. This may be a scathing indictment of modern life in some cities, but it also has a well written storyline with impact and power. Needless to say, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
I loved this movie.  Just finished watching it and felt compelled to write a review as a tribute.<br />The acting is terrific.  The fierce Hmong grandmother (Chee Thao) who traded steely glares with Clint Eastwood's character (Walt Kowalski); the selfish relatives; Walt's friends - everyone is wonderful.  Not a false note amoung them.<br />This film also serves to educate viewers about the role the Hmong people played during the Vietnam war and the consequences they endured.  Something I was ignorant of but am glad to be aware of now.<br />The many dimensions of this wonderful film have already been covered by other reviews so I'll end mine by saying ..... watch this movie.  You won't be disappointed.
Purchased this DVD as a Christmas Gift.  It was a very good movie and I would enjoy watching it again.
This was a really good movie. Clint Eastwood does another good movie role.<br /><br />Steve<br />Monroe, NC
My husband likes Clint Eastwood so I bought him this movie. We have watched it prior to buying it. I thought it was a good movie. It wasn't what I thought it was going to be, but still good & worth buying.
Clint is great in this, but not in the usual way.  He becomes endearing and the ending is a great twist on things.
Well well, Clint Eastwood- you did it again. This movie encompasses the racial tensions present in many immigrant cities in this country. I found the movie ve interesting- the ending seemed a little sudden but I would watch it again
Gran Torino opens with Clint blankly staring at his family during his wife's wake at church. The viewer can see his disgust and pain fighting for control of his emotions. Here is a man, a proud traditionalist witnessing his world disappear before his very eyes, and worst of all he sees this transformation in his own family. He seems to ask the audience if they understand what's happened.<br />Clint's character has spent his life fighting for the American ideals and purity. He has little patience for apologists (the young priest) or his greedy and distant blood family. He finds himself in the middle of a transformation that has left little of his former world intact, as he realizes that the new world around him is completely foreign,(no pun intended) not only physically but emotionally. He shows us both sides of the coin in our interactions and in our motives.The relentless putsch of nature and natural selection are also evident here as we are reminded by both clashing cultures that "we must stick to our own";happily this notion is allowed to run its course and form the abject and pitiable element of their relationships.<br />This movie forces each one of us to look ourselves in the mirror and see the prejudice, fear and disgust bred by ignorance and adherence to traditional rules. It also allow us to find the most important aspect of our role as human beings in our environment as we are confronted with the dilemma of sticking to our own traditions or doing what is morally right. Between our true self and our everyday persona, we can choose what is more important, our lives as we have lived them (attached to our environments and backgrounds)or the primordial moral high road as Clint showed us in this performance.<br />After all, this movie highlights the unmovable truth that within us all there is a very high principle and admiration for the rights of men,albeit for some in our species, the necessary precursor to bringing that justice to the forefront may be arduous at best.<br />Clint, after all seems to answer Rodney King's question with a resounding yes. We can get along, and yes we can find family in the faces of strangers when a halo of mendacity obscures our own blood kindred.
what people need to realize about this film is that the racism is merely superficial. The barbershop scene, and construction site scene are prime examples. Using epithets, but behaving in a very decent manner, is a hallmark of this movie. I was profoundly moved and impressed how Clint Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski (what a cliched last name however, i.e. Streetcar Named Desire), in effect, becomes a father figure to the two neighbor kids, Thao and Sue, who see through his "racist talk", and understand the good man he is .... while his own sons do not, are shallow, materialistic and see him as "only" racist ...<br /><br />for those who think the ending was a disappointment, let me say this ... what would any loving father do for his children, if he had to sacrifice his life to save theirs? I know if I were in "Walt's" shoes, I would have done the same. It was a brilliant ending, NOT at all disappointing.<br /><br />and ... the wrap-up (denouncement, if you will) i.e. funeral and will reading were brilliant, appropriate, and will make you smile ... maybe even shed a tear too ...<br /><br />during Clint's "Dirty Harry" days, I was kinda ambivalent ... but as writer, director, actor (with depth) he's hard to beat ... as a professional songwriter, I even like his original music ...<br /><br />I'd shake your hand anytime Clint ...
I love using this Seller for all my DDV's future purchases due to their price and free shipping... It allows me to buy ahead of time before the DVD comes out for sale. All I have to do is wait a few days after it comes out and I get the best price in town and on web guaranted... I would recommend this system of buying to anyone.
The closest to Dirty Harry 6 we'll get...<br /><br />Consider Walt the 21st century version of the 20th century Harry Callahan. Or, if you prefer, think of Walt as Harry's first cousin. (Harry took care of business on the west coast, Walt took care of the east.)<br /><br />Excellent film. It should've got Clint an acting Oscar, just as he should've got one for the original Dirty Harry.<br /><br />If this really was his last role as an actor, it was the perfect one.
Clint Eastwood a remarkable actor,director,man.A talented director sometimes starring in his own films(e.g.The Outlaw Josey Wales,Unforgiven).In the tradition of stars who project pure Americanism and rectify wrongs(Wayne,Cooper).Eastwood shows a willingness to examine his own screen persona(here comically,witness the macho talking scene in the hairdressers).He shows a willingness to engage with contemporary issues,the immigration into formerly all white areas of Hmong Asians,the kind of people he might have fought in the Korean war.He has a warrior ethic and is outwardly bigoted and not religious.However his family are only after his money and they are trying to get him into an old people's home and get his house and car.<br /><br />His real family become his next door neighbours who worship his courage and role-modelling abilities for theirson. Ever since The Outlaw Josey Wales, Eastwood has shown a propensity for empathy with marginalised people and outsiders.In this film we get echoes of Dirty Harry, Pale Rider and Unforgiven,but of a humanised kind without the fascist overtones.At the age of 78 to act,write and direct a major film is heroic.He suggests a mixing of global and local themes and shows how to wind the audience in with the unfolding of character.This film provides a great laugh but Walt has to make a great sacrifice.Stunning.
This dvd makes you think a little more about life and the way we think and behave.  It is a great movie.
hahaha this movie is great, eastwood plays a washed up recently widowed grumpy old man who in the past was fighting in korea and is haunted by the horrble things he did and the people he killed there. because of his experiences, he despises koreans, or as he calls them "gooks" but when the new neighborhs are a a family of the kind he hates, he finds that there is less truth and gorrible fiction to his foul mouthed and sometimes funny racism, as he grows close to the family and the young teenage boy and girl who live there.<br />the whole movieis mostly slap style jokes that make you feel bad that you are laughing at them,and the old tough guy looks the part and seems prefect for clint eastwod. he is awsome,<br />but underneath his crude humor there is a powerful and often moving story that will have you close to tears at the end.<br />i would recommend you buy it.<br />its just awsome.
I originally saw this movie on the big screen.  I have long been a fan of any movie with Clint in it from his early career, to Dirty Harry and his later works - thrillers, comedy and romance.  I heard this was going to be his last movie since he is getting on in years.  This was a remarkable tale of a man's life and consequences of decisions he made and must make.  It was humorous and touching at the same time.  I love his toughness hiding the soft character just beneath.  I can watch this movie again and again, catching an new angle I hadn't seen before. Truly a magnificent work!
My recent purchase of a "Grand Torino" CD met all my expectations. It arrived on time and in great shape!
This movie continues the reversial of mr. Eastwood's image while providing  evidence of his shedding further his limited range acting approach.  With few exceptions, his growing, he presents a well rounded protrayal of a bitter, intelligent 70+ ageing male bonded to a almost vanished era and tradition.  His rediscovery of his humanity and ability to extend and expand his personility and beliefs and bigotity is done exceeding well. Eastwoods direction again exceeds his acting, although this timethe spread is narrower. Well worth seeing and definately a "Dirthy Harry 5"
Great movie, Even my 80 year old mother liked it!<br />Clint Eastwood has always been great!<br />Came just in time to put in my husband's Christmas stocking.
We had seen this video before so I bought 3 of them. One for my husband, one for my father in law, and one for my brother in law. And the price was great. I buy a lot through Amazon for just this reason. The ending was a little sad but the movie overall was excellent!
ANOTHER GOOD CLINT EASTWOOD MOVIE. A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY LINE FOR CLINT EASTWOOD. A REAL SUPRISE ENDING.
This movie has lots of foul language, a lot of f-words, but if you can get past that it is an excellent movie.  Clint Eastwood still has it!
Clint Eastwood stars and directs this film  He is a graying, craggy, cranky Korean War Vet.  He lives in a tough neighborhood all alone (widower, agnostic, angry) and loath to become neighborly to a teenage boy next door, and his Hmong immigrant family.<br /><br />The movie is set in Detroit.  The economics of the times are clear and Clint plays Walt Kowalski as a racist that knows all the slurs in the book.  He is wrathful, prideful, and refuses to leave a neighborhood he is familiar with.  He sees the neighborhood deteriorating, but perseveres in holding his place.  He was well-trained in war and alert and ready for the neighborhood gangs as attempts are made to steal his prized possession, a Pontiac Gran Torino.<br /><br />This is a racial morality story, but also about personal bonds that form as we learn to live together in a changing world. There is bitter humor and deep caring as the characters learn to know each other and forget stereotypes.<br /><br />In the end, Walt gives wisdom and strength to a struggling immigrant family, as well as his most powerful performance.<br /><br />A film you will not forget.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020MKTOS">Gran Torino (Full-Screen Edition)</a>  Another great movie from Clint Eastwood.  This movie had a good story line, and the actors did a great job.  This movie had a real different ending, and  I would recomend this one to all.  The shipping time was good as usual from Amazon.
This move arrived in new condition. It was an excellent movie. At the very beginning of the movie you wonder how I can like the Clint Eastwood character because he seems so old and grouchy, but then you learn why he seems grouchy and you come to like him. The girl that plays Clint Eastwoods daughter is funny, charming and sarcastic and very lovable. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.
I hadn't seen in a movie in..drum roll please..six years. ANY movie.<br />As I bought myself a portable DVD player for Christmas for business use and for travel, I of course needed to get some movies!<br />AHHHH!!!!!!!! I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!<br />I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip.<br />When I went to Amazon's DVD page, Gran Torino was showing and of course, since I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan, it was my choice.<br />I'm stunned as to what to say and I can't really add anything that other reviewers have not already said. BTW, I concur completely with Robert Crawford's absolutely beautiful review as that says it all so well.<br /><br />The unfolding of the layers to this crotchety, bitter man is what is so special and yet at the same time so sad that this is what his sons will never know, never experience is one that hit the 'closest to home' for me and much of the sadness that I did feel in this movie. The loss. The waste.<br /><br />I also want to comment on how much I enjoyed the actress who played Sue - the girl next door. She was a fabulous actress and you adored her instantly. Conversely, I had a bit more of a difficult time 'believing' the character of the boy until much more into the movie.<br /><br />Clint is still so very handsome - one scene where he puts on a nice jacket and has a close shave and no matter his age, he's still 'got it'.<br /><br />Yes, the old man thought long and hard and came up with the winning solution to a very real and very gruesome problem. And along with that, he buried the demons haunting his heart and mind for all those years.<br /><br />The movie is sad? Yes, but the saddest part of all is that it's a reality that is a part of so many peoples' lives all the time.
This certainly deserves it's R rating, the language is phenomenally horrendously obscene.  But that actually adds to the movie in my opinion.  I'm fully aware that it's not meant to be a comedy, but I laughed through the whole thing.  It's truly entertainment at its best!!
This is not a typical shoot-em-up Eastwood flick. It takes on generational differences, ethnic differences, beauty, ugliness and sacrifice all in one well blended story. There is some language but unlike most films it is essential to the story.
It surprised me to laugh at some parts of this movie - parts meant to be funny and even some not meant to be funny. (Clint Eastwood's ire-filled character is a walking dictionary of vulgar slang, which he uses unsparingly without apologies.)<br /><br />Aside from what you likely have already read, worth mentioning is that this film is about personal growth. You'll see it in Walt (Eastwood) and Thao (Bee Vang). Observe how they change for the better - mature - then do some self-reflection.<br /><br />I think most of us out there can afford to learn from this story.
This is a movie that is more about redemption than about sheer race issues.  Kowalski lives in a run down part of Detroit, where he is a retired auto worker and Korean War Veteran.  He is a surly old man who despises everything and seemingly everyone.  His nieghborhood is totally Hmong with the only exception being him.<br /><br />We view him with his family, and interacting with his neighbors and then as you have seen in the trailers, his dealings with the local youths.  He starts a relationship with Thao and Sue, young Hmong neighbors who he builds an affinity for.  Totally politically incorrect, Kowalski spews racial and ethnic slurs in almost every sentence.  He is a bit of a loaner, especially since he became a widower, but he enjoys his car and his home and wishes his world had not changed so much.<br /><br />Kowalski calls everyone names, to their faces and he really does not care what type of rise it gets out of people.  He basically offends evryone, whites, blacks, hispanics, asians.  But you see the youth gangs from a variety of ethic perspectives and their own racism.<br /><br />Thao and Sue are like those you hear of in the news, the kids who have trouble come upon them, simply because they live in these areas.  Kowalski gets to know the Hmong, and they him.  He defends his home, his property and his friends.<br /><br />Realism although surreal, has our senses impacted when you see the results of fighting.  At times, it leads to more of the same.  Kowalski, though is a figure of redemption, he impacts everyone who knows him eventually, yet the most impact is on the viewer of Gran Torino.<br /><br />The extras in the DVD are good, more about cars than about society.  Wish there was more on the inner city and gang problems in this to complement our love affair with the big muscle cars.
I have been a fan of Clint Eastwood the actor and the<br />producer-director for most of my life and this man very rarely<br />leaves his audience disappointed!--He is a master storyteller<br />and embodies his characters wholly and completely!--This movie,<br />about a gruff, bigoted man who's neighborhood is changing in ways<br />that he doesn't like is classic Eastwood contridiction with<br />an undercurrent of humanity and a message about the<br />values of tolerance without being all "afterschool special" on us!<br />And of course, there's plenty of Clint Eastwood at his<br />butt-kicking best! I don't like to give scene by scene rundowns<br />in my reviews because I want you all to see and judge it<br />for yourselves. But this is a brilliantly acted and directed film<br />and a definite MUST HAVE for your DVD collection.
Gran Torino is a movie you must see. Clint Eastwood's performance as Walt is his best work as an actor in years.  In fact, this might be the last time we see him in a leading role.  Sure he was belligerent, prejudice, judgmental, and even racist, but it's part of what makes his character interesting.  He's brilliant and imposing, shocking and so over the top he's often funny.  This is the Clint Eastwood we all remember in a perfect, and possibly final, performance. He's riding off into the sunset in typical Eastwood fashion, snarling, growling, and spitt'n blood!
Good movie all around.  By now you know what it is about.  People will hate it or love it because of Walt's colorful use of language.  You know what, he hates everyone.  He has no prejudice in his life, he just doesnt like anyone.  Big difference.  He has a name for everyone, even his friends so I personally dont see a racist here, just an old guy that speaks his mind.<br /><br />Well done movie.  Enjoy it for what it is.
Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski, is a deeply flawed man...a man seared by all the traumas that have burned him during his many years of life.  Perhaps, the most deeply felt of his traumas, is his experience during the Korean War in which he killed...at least...thirteen of the oriental enemy, some little more than kids.  They were a lot like, or so Kowalski painfully speculates, his young Hmong friend.<br /><br />This is a tale not so much about redemption [although it could be confused as such] as a tale about the difficulty of interpreting...or judging...a person by his surface demeanor.  Kowalski is in a very real sense, every man, grown bitter and cynical with age.  He is us, filled with the prejudices which...despite all our denials...structure all of us.  Despite this, Kowalski, again like most of us, is a thoroughly decent human being.  He reacts to injustice but, like very few of us, he does something about it.<br /><br />He attempts to protect his Hmong neighbors from hoodlums.  Unfortunately, one of his actions against these punks results in reprisals in the form of a driveby shooting and a brutal rape.  Disgusted with himself and even more disgusted with the gang members, Kowalski acts deciseively to end the terror and protect 'his' oriental family.  It is, perhaps, not the ending favored by most Eastwood fans, but is all the more potent because of its simplicity.<br /><br />I enjoy he way Eastwood deals with 'racism' in this film.  Through his character, Kowalski, we see a decent man clothed in the camoflage of superficial racism.  Conversely...and I think there is a 'conversely'...we recognize that there are politically-correct individuals, who would never let an ethnic comment slip through their lips, who aren't decent people at all.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels...'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'...on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico
I have been going to movies for over 50 years, Gran Torino is the best I have ever seen. Mr. Eastwood always hits the nail on the head. No one else could have played "Wally" as well. Not only is he a brillant actor, he is one of the best Director/Producers in modern day Hollywood. I can't wait to see his next project. However, it will be very hard to top Gran Torino.
The Academy Awards have once again ignored another masterpiece by the legendary Clint Eastwood. However Gran Torino completely deserved it, it did however win Eastwood the reviews of his acting career. Both film and performance are consummately sly--coming on with deceptive simplicity, only to evolve into something complex, powerful, and surprisingly tender.<br />Walt Kowalski is a widower, Korean War veteran, retired auto worker, and apparently the last white resident of his side street. He also racist and agressive towards his new Korean neighbours and his pathetic family.<br /><br />As the film advances he starts to change his opinion towards the Koreans next door and develops a friendship between Sue (Ahney Her) and her conflicted brother Thao (Bee Vang). The trajectory of this may surprise you--several times over. Eastwood opted to film in economically blighted Detroit--a shrewd decision, but it's his mapping of Walt's world in that classical style of his that really counts. Every incidental corner of lawn, porch, and basement comes to matter and by all means the workshop/garage that houses the mint-condition Gran Torino which Walt helped build in a more prosperous era.<br /><br />This is by far Clint Eastwood's greatest film. Filled with Eastwood's style of film making and acting. This is a remarkable movie. Shame upon the Academy Awards for ignoring this film.
"Clint Eastwood's GRAN TORINO, "A White American Tragedy<br />about Hmong People," reviewed in the eyes of a Combat Veteran" - 5 stars<br /><br />I returned home from seeing Gran Torino feeling very emotional.  I had to get these feelings off my chest and so is one's veteran opinion about the fictitious Walt Kowalsky, a Korean combat veteran.  I feel I understood what the screenwriter of this fictional story was trying to teach us.  A Chinese American's review seems to be most accurate:  "You people [reviewers] are, as Walt Kowalski might say, are a bunch of jabbering dimwits."<br /><br />For all the reviewers who would rewrite the screen, note that you did not produce this movie which is destined to become an Academy winner.  Some of you expressed that the movie's hero should not have been about a White American but a hero of color -  but isn't that in itself a little racist? The movie is about the story presented and if only the critics could write successfully, they might not be so critical.  Many obvious facts can be easily assumed - so if I say that something is so in this review that was not said in the movie - it did not need saying - I know and many know- especially the vet.<br /><br />Gran Torino also provides an introduction to the American people of a unique Ethnic group - the Hmong whom Walt at first hated but got to love as his only real family. The story is about an older Korean vet (like most) who came back home worked hard, retired, then lost his wife, and held on to good basic life values.  Likely, he was never offered any treatment for his obvious chronic PTSD - so he has a few personality quirks.  He has the eyes of many aging American combat veterans in a changing American environment.  This movie perhaps is one of the most accurate reflections as to of what has happened to this country since the end of the Korean War.<br /><br />Walt or Mr. Kowalsky, as he was for his Hmong neighbors, is a real American hero.  We need more Walt's today in this country.  The young Hmong hero (Thoa- Walt's aka "Toad") learns to use a calm head when communities face difficulties.  He sets a good example as Walt helps reform him for his attempted theft of Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino that Walt help build on a Detroit factory assembly line.  Sure some Walt comments will get racial purists uptight.  However, I feel many often see a racist under every bed as the problem while neglecting their main issues.  Aren't the objected comments among many Walt-stereotyped blue-collared people more real than not?  Walt did not retreat in war nor today in his community when its racial color changed.  Although he could have moved away as encouraged by his children, he did not go to the suburbs where his former white neighbors and his children escaped.  He stayed.  So really isn't he much less a racist than the overwhelming majority of whites in this country who abandoned their former beautiful neighborhoods - now decaying - that have been overtaken by new ethnic peoples and the poor.  Look at Boston, LA, Detroit and all the big cities!  The movers and most critics do not have to say racist comments, their racism clearly is demonstrated.<br /><br />So what if he was a cranky old (80 years old?) man often saying things that "good proper Americans" should not say.  Our movies need to be about real people instead of an idealist pure people.  The story shows he hated his new Hmong neighbors until he reluctantly discovered that they were good people and who became his new "family."  As a 100% disabled combat Vietnam veteran (Special Operation Forces), I know that if you experienced what he did 55 years earlier (killing 13 enemy including a young 17 year old), your perceptions will differ little from Walt's.  After his wife died, he rejected his young priest's many efforts to effect his late wife's request for him to confess his sins. He kept his War secrets to himself.  He never discussed his War story even with his family - keeping his medals hid in a trunk in the basement.  But he did share it for a few short moments with Thao and that is central to the movie's theme.  We know that war takes a tolling affect on all warriors with a conscience- often with daily intrusions until death do them part.  Many veterans perceptions to societal changes are easily different than non-veterans.  Sometimes justifiably experienced in today's world when they see what is happening to their country for which they offered their supreme sacrifice.<br /><br />The truth is that most Korean and Vietnam veterans have referred to  their Asian enemy as gooks.  Many combat vets are easily triggered emotionally even on the sight of Asians or recollections from that period of their life.  After all, the military inspired within its combat troops that a gook was lower than a dog so that it was okay to kill him unless you allowed him to kill you.  So within the soul of many combat veterans rest this disturbing feeling that is real in their perceptions and often nightly dreams.  Don't we know that "war is hell" enough to emotionally to defeat even the best?  Yet these veterans often came home often to an uncaring people who supposedly "were against war."  But we should know that the strongest desires for peace always rest with the soldier.  Wasn't Walt trying to teach Thoa and share his experience to avoid violence because it can hurt a person's soul for a very long time.  Yet there comes a time after though when the proper person must take the risk.<br /><br />Retired White auto blue-collar workers' comments are no doubt a reaction to their  former enemies successful assumption of their American automobile manufacture as Americans adopted foreign cars and left their people unemployed.  It does not seem right for those who won the war to lose their jobs to those we helped (Koreans) or defeated (Japanese, Germans, and Italians).  If that was enough then new foreign people take over their neighborhoods.  [Anyone want a house in Flint MI for a dollar?- there are many available.]  How would you feel if your neighborhood turned into a dump because of this transition? Furthermore, unless you are blind, you must realize that minority Gangs throughout the US have an unduly affect on the poorer inner communities.  These young gangsters are subjected to constant crime and use of drugs with little hope of escape.  Most gangs are comprised- but not exclusively- today of young men of color.  Yes, Walt saw Sue Lor's white male friend unable to stand up for her when abused by a small gang of black thugs.  Walt fought the gang's destruction of his neighborhood and abuse of its Hmong peoples.  If we only had more leaders and judges who stood against this encroachment crime into our society.<br /><br />Walt knew that neither he nor the Hmong could not depend on the police to help.  He realized that this fight was best for him.  In the same way, many veterans realize that we or our allies should not depend on our military.  This movie is reflects the USA's authoritative failures to not help our allies the Hmong then and today in their new US depressed communities. Look at the story of the Hmong people.  Major General Vang Pao,  their war hero who for two decades led the Hmong in their fight against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces, repeated his comrades story, "If the United States won't help us, they should drop a bomb on us so we won't suffer any more."  The story of the Hmong, a primitive people, has been a story of US neglect and betrayal.  They were our most faithful and courageous allies during the Vietnam war.  The USA paid and encouraged them to resist the advance of Communism in Southeast Asia.  But the USA abandoned them and left them to a precarious fate when the Laotian domino collapsed in 1975.  The USA government lied and denied this operation for years until Clinton Administrations confession that the USA was the primary instigating Hmong support in Southeast Asia wars.  Today and after our confession, there still continues a genocide of thousands Hmong by the communist Lao government.  Only a few have been relocated to US Hmong Communities.  Most Hmong have been slaughtered.  These are the same people who covertly made the Ho Chi Minh trail almost impassable for the NVA to resupply military equipment to kill our soldiers.  Their actions saved innumerable lives (US and ARVN) from bloodbaths by the enemy.  Don't we owe them more respect and support?<br /><br />Are there similar stories going on today in America?  Certainly, we need more Walt's to stand up and help the Hmong.  One example of a White American accused of helping the Hmong is former Ranger Harrison Jack.  The Federal Government today continues his and the Hmong betrayal.  Our US Justice Department has indicted the retired Lieutenant Colonel Jack for a flimsy Sacramento Federal criminal case on violation of the Neutrality Act.  Also indicted in the two year old continuing case are General Vang Pao and ten (10) other Hmong Americans.  Colonel Jack led covert operations and worked with Hmong fighters during the Vietnam War. The federal indictment today describes him as the middle man between the Hmong defendants and their presumed arms dealer.  Rangers are taught to never leave their comrades behind but to make every effort to save them and bring them home safe.  What he is wrongly accused is exactly what the US Government should have been doing to resolve this overdue problem.  The US Justice Department has ridiculously exaggerated and fabricated a case of entrapment at best against Colonel Jack and the Hmong "conspirators" to provide arms for those who have not given up the fight.  Perhaps this criminal case will be an exciting future Hmong movie that Clint Eastwood will sponsor.  Knowledge of the facts in this case should also be mandatory reading for Allies of any potential US military operations.  They need to know the USA's propensity to abandon even their strongest supporters facing the worst situations.  Such a movie would make all true blooded Americans disgusted with their government.  It does not have to be fictional - the real story exists.  We never should cause a genocide again.<br /><br />In the end, Walt gave his life for these Hmong and this Hmong family could live free without intimidation by gangs.  Knowing that he would soon die probably from cancer, he made one last sacrifice plan silently offering his life.  His killing would do much more damage through the jailing of the Hmong gangsters for killing him.  He knew precisely what he was doing.  At last the young priest succeeds in securing Walt's late wife's request a confession.  His confrontation of the Hmong gang would be his final act.  He had made his peace with God with his confession.  As he confronted Sue's and his attackers for their terrible actions, they shot him repeatedly as he reached in his pocket for his First US Army Cavalry (his combat unit) lighter to light a cigarette.  He was unarmed.  And his military memory laid in his dead hand.  He knew that his life soon would be over anyway from cigarette cancer. What better way to go quickly?  Or should he await the slow cancer verdict without any benefit to anyone?  Perhaps he felt the Americans owed more to the Hmong for their faithful valor to the American Vietnam War combat soldiers.  No doubt he had learned from the Hmong of their thousands who died when the United States abandoned them.<br /><br />His sacrificial offering was for a purpose - similar to that service-people offer for us everyday.  Certainly Walt would continue as one of a very few American hero's to the Hmong.  This movie exemplifies the adage that "Old Soldiers Never Die."<br /><br />Is there a moral that transcends this story even with its many racial or crude Walt comments? You betcha.  There are many morals in this story that might someday be a classic study in schools. While fiction, it offers an excellent sociological and historic story of today's inner city and major issues as to what is going on in this society.  The screenplay's author, Nick Schenk, deserves an OSCAR.  The Hmong are still in need of American heroes instead of our chickens.  Please, Mr. Eastwood,  Give us a second Oscar winning movie about the Hmong's victory in Laos.  Many Hmong still want to go home.<br /><br />At the will reading, his children got nothing.  Walt left most of his property to the Church of the young priest.  The movie closes when Thoa Lor drives by a beautiful part of Detroit on Lake Michigan with his newly-inherited Walt's prized "1972 Gran Torino."  Sue Lor said it right - "Walt Kowalski is a good man."
It's sad to think that this is Eastwood's last appearance in a film.  I grew up watching him.  But, what a film to end on!  Hopefully, he may direct some more.<br /><br />Walt is a 'call it like you see it' kind of guy with no diplomacy skills whatsoever ( or if he has them, he chooses not to exercise them )  I think the way he speaks in this movie is the way many people think, you just don't hear it.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />He is more a grand dispenser, with no "politeness filter" of what he sees and how he tells it.  With all Hollywood puts out these days, a person who enjoys true quality has to keep their eyes open for the one of a few true gems that is put out each year.  This is one of those diamonds in the rough of 2008.<br /><br />Becauase the movie doesn't glorify gays, weirdos, or dysfunctional killers, it didn't receive any oscar nominations.  Such is the world we live in........Whoa, maybe Walt had some influence on me and I'm starting to call it like I see it.
Eastwood never gets old.  His view of an older man driven by the prejudices of his politically incorrect generation is an excellent depiction of life in the fifties shoved in the new millineum. Back when each neighborhood nationality had their own ethnic pride and were able to make fun of themselves and their neighbors.  A rare bond between diametrically opposed persons, Walt and Thao are able to breach the walls of radial diversity and look past their own cultural boundaries to understand not only the generation gap but the ethnic gap.  Truely a movie to share with friends, hamily and even strangers.  A wonderful look into the past, present and future.  Realistic violence and language.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020MKTOS">Gran Torino (Full-Screen Edition)</a>
Clint has never been mellow and he exceeded my expectations on this one.  The evolution of bitter and bigot to the finale is believable and with a startling conclusion.  One has to imagine what the Hmong are saying but body language says it clearly enough.  Clint's relationship with his own family was the balance the film needed, especially the brat grandaughter.  Few if any of Clint's films are rated this high at my house, and I have seen them all over and over.
Although Clint is getting up there in years, he still has it together.  I love the use of his WWII language in this movie. When he called the Japanese lady "Dragon Lady" I almost died laughing.  Good plot, funny as heck and worth seeing many times.  A great movie.  Get the Full-Screen edition unless you have a new LCD/Plasma tv then the Wide-Screen is ok.  I went for the Full -Screen and glad I did, even with my new LCD.<br />Bob
Received the DVD quickly and in great condition.  Would purchase from this seller again.
Product was received in good time and in perfect condition.<br />What else could you ask for?
This was a gift, so no review, except that it arrived in a timely manner.  Thanks!
What hasn't been said about Gran Torino? Probably not much is left at this point. Well here's my take on the film. It's outstanding, the best job Eastwood has done to date.<br /><br />This is a very carefully constructed film. Eastwood has to come off as a crotchety old curmudgeon, and that's easy acting for him. Within the first 20 minutes his curmudgeondom is established. The tough part for any film is that transition when the curmudgeon becomes likeable or human. Eastwood did a fabulous job at making that transition perfectly. His motivation for the relationship with his neighbors is 100% completely beleiveable. I bought it, and I've seen hundreds of films where I never bought it. The film easily climbs this hill and then rides down for the next hour to where the film's climax is established. The first indication of film trouble is at the construction office - after Walt and Tao leave the construction office, the camera focuses on the construction boss for about 10 or 15 seconds too long. It's a beat played too long. Eastwood made a few tiny errors at the final transition point, where he turns from the likeable guy with a heart to the vigilanty. The big misstep for me was when Tao comes over to Walt's house and Tao says let's go kill these guys. The dialog didn't work well, there was some odd editing, and the cage thing was just a bit too drawn out. There was symbolism here, that was good, but the pacing / editing was just jarring compared to the rest of the film.<br /><br />The most remarkable part of this film - almost every movie (bar masterpieces) have this very akward time around the midpoint of the film. Gran Torino did not have that problem, Eastwood delayed the strange transition to 7/8 of the way through the movie. An odd choice on his part.<br /><br />Blu-Ray is amazing. The sound effects are so real. Pool balls knocking together in the left rear channel sounded like they were in the house and real. It just goes on and on. Sound was so well done in this film. The images on the other hand were not so special. It was well filmed, but sadly the contrast was a bit flatter than I would have liked.<br /><br />One last bad part, turn off the sound at the last scene. Clint Eastwood performs the theme song and it's awful. No it's just plain pitiful. Don't listen, you will Van Gogh your ears if you do.<br /><br />One other odd piece, the Blu-Ray disc has almost no speical features. What is there, is lame. I mean really lame. Two pieces about the car (who really cares), and a piece about the Eastwood look. Some previews, and some nasty junk from Warner Brothers you have to sign up to get.<br /><br />Go ahead, buy this disc, it's really that good.
Why do movie-goers wait in great anticipation for the next Clint Eastwood movie??... because he's the last of the great American actors, that's why.  When Clint goes... who's left??  There's not much to choose from... Rubber face Al Pacino??... Marble Mouth Robert DeNiro??  Growth humanoid Sly Stallone??  The list is pathetic!  The simple reason we love Clint so much is he doesn't turn out drek like the rest of the above mentioned sell-outs.  We love him because in all his movies through out his wonderful career he acts with dignity... something that we as a country are in great need of and even if we have to turn to film to get it we will and that's why we look to him!  This film is no exception to Clint's long list of great films.  It doesn't turn out like your typical Dirty Harry movie but leaves you feeling there's still hope...somewhere.
Critics call Gran Torino a Dirty Harry movie. Not! You must be confused or uncaring to align Gran Torino with Dirty Harry.<br /><br />Dirty Harry was licensed violence with an unbeatable never say die spirit protecting the American way of life from the underbelly scum of life.<br /><br />Walt Kowalski is a defeated, deformed & hate filled balloon of self-pity hiding behind a mask of uncaring obscenities & the assurance of his own rightness.<br /><br />He's been hurt in a very real manner, by the war, the American society's rejection of him & his buddies, by the ability of those "gooks" to follow him across an ocean. He's hurt by the kind of kids his family has grown up to be, by how that growing up dishonors his memory of his wife (the greatest woman in the world).<br /><br />The death of his wife who was the great love of his life & the only love of post Vietnam era life he viewed as the final betrayal of life itself. Other women would be off limits as they couldn't possibly measure up to the best woman in the world.<br />It is what makes his don't come near me behavior completely unbending.<br /><br />Enter Sue Lor: He did his best I'm a foul mouthed, gook hating, no good American war vet act & she: well she wasn't shocked or repulsed or scared. She's just disconcertingly straightforward & quietly persistent. By god, she's a little mystifying. She's, She's sorta like the best woman in the world. It was these qualities that attracted his positive attention & allowed Sue to restore his faith in women along with the Hmong family restoring his faith in society. Remember the line, "By god I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own family."<br /><br />He says to himself: Self he says (sorry I couldn't stop it), we need to check this out closer. Hope is reborn! He thinks, what she likes will be worthy of liking, what she loves will be worthy of loving & what she dislikes will be dishonorable. He still understands & believes in honor & dishonor. It's the only thing that has kept him from descending to a beast.<br /><br />The Hmong had everything that he wanted in a person, a family & a society except maybe bravery displayed by action. He now has a cause & a purpose. THIS AIN'T DIRTY HARRY. It's Romeo & Juliet without the sex.<br /><br />From my great enemy is sprung my great love. Just because it's a thought from a Vietnam vet about a Hmong family does not reduce the truth & wonder of that statement. Once again, remember the line: "My god, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own family." I would add their society also.<br /><br />The most un-Dirty Harry like thing of this show (it's huge) is the fact that it starts with a man that has given up on life. His wife is gone, his kids suck & his health is gone. This isn't the kinda guy that lays in bed waiting for the grim reaper. He is looking for a way to commit suicide without dishonor. If you didn't pick up on the suicide bit early maybe you were Dirty Harry befuddled too. His sacrifice at the end was his honorable cause.<br /><br />The first time he coughs up blood I told my wife, "He's a suicide looking for a place & a reason to happen." The only value he had retained at that point was honor so he couldn't sit down & "eat" his rifle. Having found another best & honorable woman he felt he could follow her to a suitable cause. His relationship with Thao was instigated by Sue not the attempted theft. He then found his cause through Thao. The giving of his life reflects his rediscovered belief that life is worthwhile & something to die for is good. He had that going to Vietnam & lost it there.<br /><br />Now he is full cycle: From disillusionment & hate back to hope & love. He surely loves the people he gave his life for & hopes it improves their life.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that the beating & rape of Sue didn't unhinge his mind again (the suicide was already planned folks).It was as if he finally understood THERE ISN'T JUST ONE BEST PERSON IN THE WORLD THERE ARE MANY. His faith was restored.<br /><br />Tremendous show!
After reflection, discussion and further reflection, I'm raising my rating from  4 to 5 stars for this late-career Eastwood achievement.  Of the films I've seen in the new millennium, "There Will Be Blood" stands out as the most "artful"--a nuanced, complex, serious piece of moviemaking that pulls out all the stops--scripting, acting, and cinematography (above all, the creative, even daring, use of montage and mis en scene to "tell the story" rather than the usual reliance on script, close-ups, and talking heads).  By contrast, "Gran Torino" breaks no new ground and demands far less of its viewer as a reader of film per se: instead, it demands a viewer who can handle a serious social issue and accept as "heroes" characters largely viewed as non-sympathetic by the majority of the American public.  But above all, "Gran Torino" required a director with Eastwood's deep convictions about fair play and his sympathies with the underdog--so much so that he was willing to put his name and money on the line regardless of the outcome at the box office.<br /><br />I viewed the film at the recommendation of my son, who no doubt was, like most viewers, initially attracted to it by the title.  Equally certain is that he, like most viewers, was moved by more than the car (though it's a nice car, not unlike a few big old Fords we've had in the family).  But the actual subjects in this film are tolerance, redemption and community--and Eastwood, as is his custom, finds it in an unlikely place--or rather, among an unfamiliar people--the much misunderstood, maligned, and even demonized Hmong people.  Clint's character is that of a crusty old Korean war veteran who interprets the world around him according to the bible of Archie Bunker, stereotyping people at every opportunity, cracking politically-incorrect jokes, and talking in a profane and scatological argot ironically not unlike that of the young minority gang-bangers he views as a nemesis. The primary "action" is not the predictable violence, beating and shooting stemming from the vigilante justice that is a trademark of Eastwood films but the conversion of Clint from flint to "father"--not of his distant, materialistic biological children but of a Hmong boy who suffers from low self-esteem while seeking significance and stability among even his own people.  Eastwood's character and the Hmong boy (originally an unwelcome neighbor who lives next door to the recently widowed Eastwood who, with the exception of his old dog Daisy, experiences a chosen isolation not all that different from the boy's).  Eventually, Eastwood becomes a virtual family member among the Hmongs and gets the son he never had (though at the price of his life), and the Hmong boy in turn gets an affirming father along with the latter's coveted '72 Gran Torino and, through his newly acquired self-confidence, the Hmong girl he had been too shy to look at, much less go after.<br /><br />These are commendable sentiments, and even without the twist of the Hmong neighbors, Eastwood's skills both as a director and actor assure a result that rises above the plot of what is basically a formulaic film, with a number of developments most likely conveyed to a good share of the audience well before they occur.  What's somewhat regrettable is the appearance of the film at a time when the nation is so splintered (bifurcated, may be the word) into two camps, one respecting poltical process and the highest office, the other seemingly thinking some sort of vigilante justice is a defense against terrorism rather than a contributor to it.  It's appalling to read polls suggesting that half of the nation has regressed to two "basic needs": Give me my guns, and don't tax me.  Even more disturbing is reading of political rallies to which people are drawn while packing firearms.  (Undeniably, that's one solution to the current problems with the economy and its failure to provide sufficient jobs: kill enough people, and eventually demand will come into closer alignment with supply.)<br /><br />In literature courses, teachers often try to discourage students from falling victim to the "intentional fallacy" ("Shakespeare wrote to entertain theater-goers and REALLY meant to say to be or not to be a ticket buyer is the question"; or "You're making too big a deal out of the poem.  Maybe all Frost meant to say was that he went on a walk, came to a fork, and took the less-traveled one to be different.").  But once a literary piece (or film) is born, it takes on a life of its own.  Attempts to read the author's mind are naiive, presumptuous and beside the point.  So even though Eastwood's character ends up with a cigarette lighter in his right hand rather than the magnum pistol it's assumed he's reaching for, the strange hold that guns have, especially on Americans, the potential of guns to "equalize" us all, quickly and decisively, is a stronger, more lingering image, I'm afraid, than the restored Gran Torino.  If Eastwood makes one more film (he had vowed before "Gran Torino" to do no more acting), I can't imagine a stronger, more valuable or memorable closer than a movie exposing guns for the anachronisms they have become in a civilized society.  But given his love of jazz and American music, I know that he would support, instead of guns in young people's hands, a musical instrument, preferably one that is not a synthesizer.<br /><br />I viewed the film in Blu Ray, though Eastwood's preference for a "noirish" cast, even to his color tones (witness a first-class Eastwood film noir gem like "Tightrope" from 1985), makes normal DVD an equally compelling choice.<br /><br />[Coda: An undeniable item of curiosity (apart from its critical importance to the plot) is the cigarette lighter that replaces the handgun in Eastwood's final scene.  At a point midway in the film we see him coughing up blood, and a comment by the Hmong boy (or is it his sister?) that he should stop smoking strongly implies that he's suffering from lung cancer (given his stubborn character, a doctor would be the last to know).  So either way--a gun or a lighter--the object in his left shirt pocket is emblematic of his end, the only question being whether it will be instantaneous or prolonged. It's even plausible that he knows his days are numbered and chooses what he believes is the best way out for all concerned.]
I enjoyed this movie very much.  I only have a couple of negatives.  I feel that the actor who portrayed Thao wasn't that great.  There were a couple of scenes where he didn't look that convincing.  Another complaint is that I wish there were more extras on the blu-ray.  A big positive was Clint Eastwood's performance.  He was perfect in this role.  The actor who portrayed Thao's sister was also excellent.  If you're a fan of Eastwood, you'll enjoy this movie.
This is a great movie. The end is a little weak but all the rest is fabulous. Thank you Clint for believing in the American Dream, and bringing these fabulous Hmong actors and actresses to the screen and to the awareness of the American Public.
Don't let the 1st half hour get you down, since it is so harsh.  The movie is a classic!
I didn't see this movie as racist but story of a tired, aged, well-experienced man finding a purpose to his life at the end. It also shows the multi-cultural US in our times. Interaction between characters was interesting and it was surprisingly funny at times. Although some characters were too stereotyped (Walt's family, the goons, teen friends) ,  it worked for the rest of the story. The supporting characters were drawn well, the well-meaning but inexperienced priest, the babbling grandma, the dog, traditional mom. The sister's character was the brightest and added the pleasantness to the dark story. The quiet boy trying to stay away from trouble was admirable. I had hard time understanding what the brother and sister were saying, the speech wasn't very clear.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood carries the movie alone and does it fabulously. I didn't see the twist at the end coming but I do wish it was more realistic in the line of the rest of the movie. But all in all it was a satisfying end. And a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
Ok so the car ..uh kinda cool... but come on .. could have been better.. but the story was very strong. Eastwood is brilliant when it comes to storyline and direction. He is a tough old man that is very prejudice.. it is his struggle to deal with his prejudice in the face of serious injustice. Justice is served in classic Eastwood fashion... I only took 1 star away for the choice of his vehicle and some poor acting with some of the cast..lol but he ties why this car is his baby.. another great Eastwood film.
Great movie in Blu Ray<br />Great Delivery and the product was as stated Used Like new
I really enjoyed this movie, even though it was difficult at some points to really immerse myself into the story because the acting of Hmong kids was not convincing...I am referring to Sue and Thao....would have been a perfect 5 stars if the acting was good. :-(<br /><br />Aside from that a very entertaining movie with a lot of expletives and racist comments, but all the same very humorous.<br /><br />Would recommend to those not offended by off color, racey (and I do mean RACEy) humor.
Great Movie, I used it in one of my Human Services classes at college to discuss the issue of diversity.  It was very well produced, great acting.
I received this dvd in perfect condition, a great price and really fast delivery!  A+

There's nothing that I can add that hasn't been said by reviewers far more literate than I am.  As a fan beginning with Clint's "spaghetti westerns" done on extremely low budgets, then moving on to the Dirty Harry series, his more modern westerns, the various law enforcement and military themes, and finally to the more esoteric "Million Dollar Baby" and "Mystic River", Mr. Eastwood seldom fails to entertain.  His commentaries on the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity and on man's reliance on self are consistent threads in his firms.  Since his media of choice is film, his examples are a bit overblown, but hey -- these are the movies! His message may have become a bit more subtle over the years, but his basic movie making premise seems to be "if it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing".  Now that's entertainment.
Since so many reviews here have provided a plot summary, I'm just going to write comments...<br /><br />There were many, many points in this movie that made me cringe, expecting to be run over by sentimentalism and stereotypes.  For example when Kowalski takes Thao with him to teach him "how to be a man"---I thought they'd wind up in a bar with a bunch of K's buddies competing to see who had the biggest wanger, but no something else entirely (not all that believable, but at least it was rather original) happens.<br /><br />So this movie is a lot like that.  It directly addresses and traffics in some all-too-common racial stereotypes and bigotry, yet somehow manages to transcend them in a way that is not hopelessly corny or preachy.  The ending is rather surprising, kind of Buddhist in fact---true self-sacrifice, a little idealistic perhaps, but at least not the usual macho-superhero-vigilante fantasy.  Considering Eastwood's filmography and iconic image, "Gran Torino" is actually very subversive, in its quiet and understated way.  There is a subtle element of satire and parody here, which most viewers will probably miss: Eastwood is actually poking fun at cranky aggrieved old white guys and their cartoonish ideas about masculinity.  At the same time he presents an alternative scenario in which that bitter old geezer finally becomes a TRUE man, i.e. a FULL HUMAN BEING, by growing beyond his own petty prejudices and, at the surprise ending, transcending his own ego and truly sacrificing himself wholeheartedly and voluntarily---in contrast to being a frightened overgrown boy forced to play soldier by the Army.<br /><br />My only reservations, and the reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars, is that Eastwood could have been a better director in terms of eliciting better performances from his two Hmong leads, Bee Vang and Ahney Her, who reminded me of kids acting in a school play.  Bee Vang is especially amateurish, especially in the last part when Kowalski locks him in the basement to prevent him from following.  Surely Eastwood could've hired acting coaches to better prepare and train these two?<br /><br />I was also disappointed with the Special Features on the DVD...basically it's a vintage car fan's wet dream, and there's lots of sophomoric babbling about cars and "masculinity"---but what about for the rest of us?  A little mini-documentary snippet on the history of the Hmong and their dealings with the US military in Indochina would have been much more interesting and apropos. Well, unless all the macho car gushing is part of Eastwood's hidden joke.
I loved the movie, but did not like Clint being killed in the end. I truly understand why/ Just did not like to see it/
Indeed, Walt Kowalski says he's no hero, and he isn't.  Except that he is an old man deeply troubled enough by his acts in the Korean War to stand up for those unjustly persecuted.  The story is compelling, but considering Eastwood's brilliance and success behind other films the star quality just did not convey in this one.  Kowalski was well-acted, though it was Ahney Her as Sue who shone.  She was the only one who seemed to be in the part and not just acting it.  The flow of the film was a bit slow and its transitions quite choppy.  The editing just did not seem to be on par, which resulted in some of characterization of Kowalski seeming contrived if not completely off.  Despite its patchy qualities this film delivers a powerful story, that while potentially predictable does not detract from its power.
Warning: Contains minor spoilers.<br /><br />I finally saw Gran Torino six months after it didn't win Academy awards.  After waiting for so long I figured it couldn't possibly live up to the hype.  Anticipating some anticlimactic, less ethnic Boondock Saints, I resigned myself to catch up with Clint Eastwood's revered vision.  Despite myself, I became totally absorbed.  The film was ethnic, religious, and more interesting than I'd even heard.<br /><br />Archetypes in film are usually boring.  I can't stand it when a movie is full of flat, one-dimensional characters doing exactly what the viewer expects them to do.  At first I was distracted by the number of one-dimensional characters in Gran Torino.  Set in a ghetto at the edge of a Ford factory town, it's a perfect illustration of ethnic and temporal clash to characterize America's history.<br /><br />Perhaps the setting is even more perfect now, with Bud falling to inBev and GM falling to Congress.  In the very first scene the main character buries his wife.  A laughably archetypical young, Irish priest drones about life and death while Clint Eastwood rolls his eyes heavenward, his estranged family unsurprisingly irreverent.<br /><br />All the elements are there.  It's so expected it's annoying.  Ethnic stereotype. Check.  Industrious old man irritated that his young family doesn't get it.  Check.  It's about family, it's about America, it's about the working class in fringe neighborhoods that have always made this country strong.  Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a "Polack" who would've been among the first wave of Ford-strong workers.  See also his hair dresser, a machismo Italian Kowalski accuses of being "half-Jew" when he charges a wopping (ahem) $[...] for his monthly haircut belongs to that same storied first generation.<br /><br />Every element in this movie is one-dimensional, and yet . . . it's perfect.  Eastwood's character rejects the Irish priest, charged by his late wife with the task of "taking special care of this sheep" in his "flock" of parishioners, when the priest begins hounding him to confess.  When pressed, Kowalsk shares a beer with the priest, wet behind the ears next to Eastwood's hard-lined complexion.  He explains that the "overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold superstitious old women's hands and make promises he can't keep" knows nothing about life and death.  Kowalski spent three years killing (even, we later learn, when not so ordered) in Korea.  He calls the priest "Padre," rather than the deferential, traditional "Father."<br /><br />Only later, after a few ethnic in's and out's, does Kowalski accept a religious touch.  Evidently it's not that he rejects religion; he only needs a father figure, as do we all, to provide spiritual guidance.  A Hmong shaman "reads" him (predictably) exactly right.  Kowalski is stunned, coughs up blood, shares solace and rice alcohol with a member of that family, and his fatherly bond is sealed.<br /><br />Gran Torino is not about the characters.  Each player is only a vehicle for Eastwood's point.  Indeed, while the characters are flat, the acting is rather good.  The youngest Hmong cousin, haunted by a family gang and first exposed to Kowalski when he tried to steal the title car, is young and weak (Kowalski later calls him a "puss-bag") at first.  He's smart but unfocused--the ghetto offers little in the way of goals.  We pretty clearly see the kid grow under Kowalski's influence.  The former soldier teaches "Toad" to paint a house, hammer a roof, tend to a garden.  He takes him to see the barber and teaches him to "talk like a man" (NB: the barber is reading a 1935-style porn when the boys walk in, with women stretched out like the silhouettes on truck mudflaps).  Kowalski rags on Toad to date a beautiful Hmong girl ("Yum Yum") who keeps giving him the eye.<br /><br />In short, Kowalski imparts self respect through productive actions.  He's kind of a Hank Hill (from King of the Hill) in the gratuitously-stereotypical neighborhood.  He finds himself, like a serendipitous vigilante, in a position to save the Hmong Su from a black gang.  Su sasses the thugs for calling her a "bitch and a ho in the same sentence--way to be a stereotype."  Kowalski finds himself a role model for a huge Asian ethnic group with historically weak male role models ("girls go to school; boys go to jail"), and a savior where no one else can stop the intrafamiliar gangs that seem to pervade the ghetto.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat suprising.  We know that Kowalski faces painful treatments for the rest of his life to eradicate whatever evil caused the thick blood in his cough.  He finally confesses, spilling three sins that tarnish the very soul of a man with integrity, but elicit only a "that's it?" from the ghetto priest.  He buys a suit, retools his will, and has long-since accepted that his "family" are the Hmong he respects, not the second-generation Toyota-drivers (predictably) pushing Dad to a home.  What's surprising isn't that he dies, but that the ending preserves the flat, illustrative essence of each character while managing to weave them perfectly in as coherent a finish as the rest of the film.<br /><br />The movie isn't surprising, but it's still beautiful.  We have lost so much of the integrity once the heart of the American dream.  Those  of us who wail about politics cite anecdotal evidence so far removed from personal experience that we might as well be opining on the European Union.*  I loved this film for taking one-dimensional archetypes easy to understand and weave a story around them that's faceted, intelligent, more profoundly true than merely political, and . . . perfect.<br /><br />Where Boondock Saints made me want to go vigilante on gangsters' asses, this movie made me want to tend to the margins.  I wanted to go home and fold clothes haphazardly tucked into the drawer.  I wanted to wash my car, care for my things, perhaps consider a victory garden.  I wanted to drop the multi-dimensional pretexts that detract from integrity and simply do things right.<br /><br />This movie reminded me that the American Dream with which I'm so obsessed isn't about making it big (though it's about that too), but rather about making it.  It's only the sum total of tucked hospital corners, waxed hubcaps, crossed t's and dotted i's that make a college education, a marriage (save Kowalski's indiscretion in 1968 with Betty Jablonski at a company Christmas party), and a life.<br /><br />So in the end the movie is--predictably!--about life and death.  All the usual elements are there: religion, intrigue, ethnic warfare and paternal protection.  Kowalski finds purpose in his last months, and, after a life well-lived, finally finds something for which he's ready to die.  Nothing about this film is particularly surprising.  But the skill behind weaving these flat elements is impeccable.  There are worse things than living with purpose and integrity, and in the end finding the story to be perfect.
Great movie!  Clint Eastwood talks just like the average older white guy from the Detroit area.
I was so very happy. It said the item wouldn't be shipped until August 4th or 5th, and to my surprise I got it on August 5th... Just a few days after I ordered it.. Excellent  service, it was in great condition and I'm very happy with my purchase..
I ordered this movie and I received in two days later.  In excellent condition and the service was also excellent!!
I had seen this movie b4 i got it and knew i wanted it for my colection
Not what I expected, but still good.  Slow moving, for the most part, but, still, worth seeing.
UNEXPECTED ENDING, BUT TOTALLY ENGROSSING MOVIE.  I ALWAYS LOVED CLINT EASTWOOD AND HE DIDN'T LET ME DOWN.
Mr. Eastwood just gets better and better with age.  He was totally beliveable in this role.  What an ending!
Would that Hollywood were still filled to the brim with men of Eastwood's character. This is a straightforward, no-punches-pulled story of part of a America as she exists today. And a sad state of affairs it is. This film accurately and painfully depicts the kind of cultural clash and disrespect of valor and elder experience that's eroding the foundation of what this country stands for. At the end of this movie, the question is quite clear: Who, after men like this are gone, will possess and demonstrate the integrity of this man?
Thanks, for showing me that good movies are still being made, and great<br />actors still have the passion to make them.
THIS IS EASTWOOD AT HIS BEST BOTH AS AN ACTOR AND A DIRECTOR, THE STORY CENTERS ON WALT KOWALSKI (EASTWOOD) WHO HAS RECENTLY LOST HIS WIFE, HE IS ESTRANGED FROM HIS FAMILY AND DEEPLY RESENTS THE ASIAN FAMILY WHO MOVED NEXT DOOR, THROUGH A STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCE HE IS FORCED TO SPEND TIME WITH THE NEIGHBOR BOY AND OVER TIME FORMS A FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM, THE BOY IS BEING PRESSURED TO JOIN THE LOCAL GANG AND WALT INTERVENES ON THE BOYS BEHALF WHILE I DON'T WANT TO DISCLOSE TO MUCH OF THE STORY TO YOU, IT DOES HAVE AN UNEXPECTED ENDING,EASTWOOD'S CHARACTER IS A BITTER OLD RACIST WITH A DRY BITING SENSE OF HUMOUR, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE LOCAL PRIEST WHO IS TRYING TO SAVE HIS SOUL.  THIS IS RUMOURED TO BE EASTWOOD'S LAST ACTING ROLE, AND IF THAT IS THE CASE HE WENT OUT ON TOP<br />  RANDY
I may be one of the few to think "Gran Torino" to be an over-rated movie. But watching Clint Eastwood play a cranky old racist who finally gets melted by a pair of adolescent Asian immigrants felt wholly contrived to me. Walt (Eastwood) has shiftless and greedy family members who he can't stand, neighbors that disgust him, a young priest who he treats like a punk and a few old cronies at the bar he can make racist jokes with. But when he discovers the kid who first tried to steal the Gran Torino of the film's title ain't the gang-banging type, Walt decides he will make a real man out of the kid and make up for the failed sons he thinks he didn't teach right.<br /><br />Which makes him the Cop from the even worse movie, "Crash." "Gran Torino" earns its fourth star based on Eastwood, who plays Walt with such effortless slyness that he manages to coast through the movie on sheer force of will. The other is the teenage Hmong sister Sue (Ahney Her), who has picked up American spunk and sasses to Walt in a manner that makes him learn acceptance (sort of). When Walt stops a bunch of gang members from attacking Sue and her brother (with the infamous "Get off my lawn" trailer quote), Walt becomes their reluctant hero...and the gang's new enemy.<br /><br />As the conflict builds and Walt moves towards the inevitable gang showdown, "Gran Torino" stumbles. I could guess the ending from a mile away, and seeing the previously stone-cold racist Walt suddenly make this kind of turn-about felt too "feel-good" to not ring false. Anyone but Eastwood would have made this a car-wreck, but in his skilled hands, "Gran Torino" remains a decent movie to watch.
Does everybody knows if this movie has spanish subtitles???<br />please let me know..cause I want to buy it on blue-ray
I like this movie, it reminds me so much of my father. The drill Sgt in the Marines and a Police Officer for 34 years. RIP Dad 1947-2006<br />This movie, is just great. It is one of my favorites.<br />You won't be disappointed!
Another goodie from an oldie. Eastwood excellent as usual. Classic example of suburban prejudice leading to new understandings and unfortunately tragic endings. Eastwood plays a character full of pride in himself and country, who comes up against newcomers, a Hmong family, who at first glance,  appear to be aliens in his street/world. Once he gets past his initial prejudice regarding the family, he realises that they are just like any other family, with all their flaws, just like his own. He soon realises that they are victims of crime, trying to avoid the insidious grasp of brutal Detroit streetgangs.  He sees a situation that he can change and with a lot of guts, savvy and understanding is able to open everyones eyes. Sadly, life is not always as straightforward nor does it always run smoothly and the choice he makes in the end, in the action he undertakes, serves a twofold purpose - tragic as it is. Good movie, well crafted and well acted.
This was great.  I hope I'm a sour old [..]like him when I get into my 70s.
This film is overly cliche and way too ridiculous in context. I am sorry but I would have given this 3 stars if this hadn't one of the most awful and predictable endings in movie history. All I can think is Clint was on meds or people around him were saying it was great. I almost shut it off before the credits. WHY?<br /><br />Why would you end a film with such horrible acting, context, and direction that goes against pretty much what you were trying, or so I thought, to build up the entire film. Sure there was going to be a confrontation. But a whole house of people? Come on man. This is just beyond reality. I was immediately taken out of the film by the end but some of the wooded as hell acting and script surely did not help up to that point. It is pretty obvious that Americans have been so damn inundated by soap opera and TV shows that they can't even judge a decent film anymore. If this is five stars than damn near anything with a good message is five stars.<br /><br />The gangs are portrayed as a bit too mindless and Clint himself is too gruff and disembodied to suddenly change ways and start loving and caring for these people. THERE IS NO SUBTLY in this film but with a couple of the better scenes.<br /><br />I will say the dinner between Clint and the neighbors was a great scene and made the enormous gap in their relationship seem worth the jump. I like scenes like these in films. But this film has far too few of them. I can't give this any more than 2 stars because quite simply it's not that great even besides the ending. I really thought I was in for a masterpiece here and came away quite disappointed. Clint's output has been quite up and down lately in my mind. Films like Mystic River are much better imo, albeit they have the same tendency to annoy with the ending, and ones like these are mediocre because they do not build properly for one and another because of the quality of the acting and script.<br /><br />Mystic River had a lot of things going for it that this one simply does not. I for one saw the ending in that film to be much more subtle. I wasn't sure of Bacon's plans for Penn's character and to me it was more ambiguous than not. This one is just outright crude. This man has made films as great as The Bridges of Madison County, A Perfect World, and Unforgiven and he has also made entirely overrated stuff like Million Dollar Baby and tripe like Space Cowboys. You never know what you are in for but it seems in his old age he likes those shocking endings. This one is not as bad as Baby but I can't say I enjoyed it that much. That's how she goes.
Clint Eastwood does it again. He brings his bad-assedness to the screen in full force. I bought this movie for my girlfriend because we both love Clint's movies, and she loves this one in particular. She watches this thing easily once a month, sometimes more.<br /><br />If only I could get her to sit thru some of Clint's more obscure works, like 'Eiger Sanction' or even 'Kelly's Heroes' I think she would appreciate him even more.<br /><br />I would have given this movie 5 stars, if the Hmong acting wasn't so bad...<br /><br />Like my writing?

This is one of the best movies in this past decade and could not believe it was being offered at the price it was. definitely recommend this to anyone who loves action movies
I've watched this movie several times on DVD. but i'm not satisfied, so I bought this blu-ray.<br />I've watched it all over again. I love the story.
Serious drama.  Heart felt but a one time view.  Make sure that you get the best price cause you may not want to watch it more than once.
I watched this movie on television this weekend and was moved to tears.<br /><br />Many people in this country (this world) beleive that bigotry and hatred are justified and justifiable. But never can a person be more deluded, unless people argue such bigotry and hatred as being a product of Godliness. Egads.<br /><br />Bigotry never stems from hatred toward others for their differences, bigotry and hatred eminates from individuals sense of self-loathing and inadequacy.<br /><br />Walt is an angry, hatred filled man whose attitudes helped shape and were further validated by, his dysfunctional dissonance toward life and living. Not being provided much context prior to his military service, one can only assume personality and behavior across the lifespan. However, Walt's military service alone is shown to be enough to cause great self-assuredness and egocentrism, while also creating the perpetuated myopic and callous racist and sexist views. The stern disciplinary behavior of a soldier is the fortitude and even arrogance presented by Walt, while the eternal burden of guilt of killing others create a complex, sympathetic character of an angry old man confronted by the meanings of life.<br /><br />His relationship with his own children is strained. Who is to blame is left to presumption, however considering his children's shallow, biggoted (elderly are feable people to take from and diminish through patronization) and estrangement, it is obvious within the film that they are far less sympathetic than the targets of Walt's venom and vitriole.<br /><br />Walt's strongest display of true confidence is when he locks away the vulnerable Thoa in his basement and avers that the greatest suffering that Thoa could ever experience would be that of killing another human being. Walt recognized that the enemey soldiers that he killed in battle were nothing more or less than he, frightened soldiers doing what they were ordered to do. They were human beings.<br /><br />More so, Walt's bigotry is confronted head on when he steps into a social ill beleiving that he is only protecting his own self interests (his property from the disturbance of tussling neighbors and idiotic gang members.) From his single act of selfish heroism, Walt is subjected to all of the trappings of a vastly disparate culture, one which is based less in individuality and more in social structure, respect for culture and all of the cultures vulnerabilities.<br /><br />With the help of a brazenly self-confident and enlightened young lady, Walt learns that life is not as it seems and that human beings (as opposed to cretins) are more complex and decent when viewed from various perspectives. What Walt previously interpreted as weakness and untrustworthiness, is in fact respectfulness and honor toward family. When that respect and honor is presented to Walt, he quickly recognizes some strengths within (such as good food) and opens his doors slightly to accept some of the fruits of the diverse culture. This is furthered by the opportunistic young lady who further educates Walt and (with the indentured help from the confused Thoa), shows that in truth, Walt "has more in common" with the odd characters that he has long loathed, than he has with his "own family."<br /><br />Thus, Walt not only begrudgingly changes his views, but his behaviors and ultimately sacrifices his own life in his one grand effort to make amends for all that has long tortured his soul... and to give life to someone else who is at the crossroads between good and evil (being pulled hardest from the dark side.)<br /><br />Ultimately, Walt shows that love is for the world entire... and that we are all far more alike than we are different. If we all could open our eyes and our hearts, push aside our fears and angers... we just might be able to defeat the hatred and corruption and live in peace for one another, instead of for ourselves (our fears and angers.)<br /><br />Thank you Clint Eastwood, for giving us GRAN TORINO. I wish I had put aside my own bigotry (toward your tough guy, vengeance seeking, immature machismo filled action films) and allowed myself to watch this movie long ago.
It is definitely not what I thought it was about.  But when all is said and done it really is a good movie.
I've always liked Clint Eastwood outside the "western genre", and Gran Torino is a great "don't get mad, get even" role for the famous actor.
The seller communicated to say the product was on the way.  It was delivered very promptly.  In fact I ordered, I think, 5 items.  This was the first to arrive and very in great condition (though I haven't watched it yet!).  Two of the items in the order haven't arrived as of yet.  Three arrived in a timely fashion.<br />Thanks to the seller and Amazon.com.

WHAT A GREAT MOVIE. CLINT EASTWOOD IS AWESOME. THERE IS NEVER A DULL MOMENT. I HAVE BOUGHT THIS MOVIE FOR 4 OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS ALREADY. YOU WONT REGRET WATCHING " GRAN TORINO ". ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS ! IT SHOULD HAVE ONE "BEST PICTURE "
Few films have been able to translate an aspect that war can have on surviving veterans - that aspect being the embedded hate for 'the enemy' that dominates the world view of those who have had to fight in the battlefields, a hate that too easily translates into generalized racism that persists throughout the life of the veteran.  GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on our American Family.<br /><br />GRAN TORINO as written by Nick Schenk and Dave Johanson and as produced, directed and acted by Clint Eastwood is not a film easy to hear or watch in its early portions.  Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is burying his wife, only to return to his long term home in a neighborhood that has become a sanctuary for Hmong people (an ethnic  group  from the mountain regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma who supported US troops and were evacuated to the US after the Vietnam conflict).  Kowalski is a prejudiced bigot who loathes the presence of the (unnamable epithets) neighbors.  Next door is a family that includes a young loner boy Thao (Bee Vang) and his worldly sister Sue (Ahney Her) - two young people caught up in the Hmong world where the girls go to school and become employed and the boys go to jail.  Kowalski reluctantly befriends a gang threatened Thao and the neighborhood rewards him with endless gifts of flowers and food.  Gradually an event secures Kowalski's attachment to Thao and Kowalski grows to understand and respect 'the enemy' - people who are genuinely kind and loving despite Kowalski's personality and lonely bitter veteran's life.  The transformation of Walt Kowalski as played by Eastwood is genuinely touching and the way in which the movie ends is surprisingly sophisticated.<br /><br />There are moments in this bumpy script that are so trite and repetitive and stereotyped that the film becomes almost unwatchable.  But it is to the credit of the cast and Eastwood's direction that eventually the repeated verbal slurs of racial hatred make the resolution of the film even more powerful.  There are many lessons to be learned by listening and watching this film, not the least of which is insight into the psyches of war veterans from all wars.  Grady Harp, June 09
Mabey Eastwoods best film<br />My only complaint is I'm missing two important shots.<br />One an airel view of Kawalskis property like an island in a sea of disrepair.<br />The second when Sue asks Walt to be father to her and Tow.<br />Clint, how can you let people mess with your work?
I must admit, I saw Gran Torino in the theater and loved it.  I haven't watched the Blu-ray disc yet, but the price was right and shipping was pretty quick.  A nice little gift to myself!
Having just watched Clint Eastwoods Grand Torino, I find myself remembering the Clint Eastwood movie HEARTBREAK RIDGE. Clint Eastwoods character in Heartbreak Ridge and Grand Torino give me a literal 25 year story of an honorable American soldier.
I enjoyed this movie immensely.  My only complaint would be the close-ups of Clint as he would begin to get mad.  It almost seemed comical, though I am sure that was not the intent.  Overall, the movie was great!
i really enjoyed this movie and thought it was fantastic, the acting as well as the presentation. for a change it lived up to my expectations. thanks.
Correction!  There are closed captions, they are in the language section as subtitles in English for the hearing impaired.  Now I want to change my rating from 4 to 5 stars (but the web page won't let me edit that).<br /><br />(original review)<br />I lose some of the subtlety of this film that I heard in the theater because there were no closed captions.  This is a really great movie though!  I am curious if the wide screen version has closed captions.
i loved this movie, it was good.... ya the acting wasnt the best but the story was really good.
This is a terrific movie that you shouldn't miss.  It is in many ways complex with the issues that are thrown together and juxtaposed in the same frames.  Walt doesn't connect with his own family, yet he finds a new one in the place he least expects.  In a very general sense, His darkest secrets and tragedy in Korea are connected to his saving grace in the Hmong.  The challenges of old age are mirrored with the struggles of youth.  Despite these complexities, the film itself is stripped to it's simplest.  No overpowering smultzy soundtrack, no expensive sets.  Walt isn't particularly likeable at any point, even as the hero.  There is an attempt to be somewhat real life which makes this movie run a little slow but it's attempt is valid.  It also accounts to some degree for the one thing I really thought was weak in the movie.  There are some really bad lines and they are very poorly delivered.  I know they made a big deal over this movie and many aspects of it deserved some praise.  However, I don't know about academy awards.  I think it was more of the simbolism to Eastwood's career and the "lifetime achievement" factor.  This movie is definitely not well acted.  Even Eastwood's performance is a little over the top, mostly comprised of sneers and growls.  It doesn't matter.  It's still a great movie, but it does distract one from the positives you will find here.  The character of Sue is really the saving grace in the acting department.  I think she steals the show.  This is one you won't want to miss.  Just don't buy it outright.  It is not the kind of movie you watch over and over.
Good movie but after 40 minutes I fast forwarded it (too busy) and not motivated to see a grumpy old man frown for another hour - but the parts I watched were capturing so I'd say this is a good movie.
Video was full screen and it was zoomed in too much. I seen the movie millions of times and can tell right away what is wrong with it. You get what you pay for.
The DVD movie was in good condition and the quality of the picture and audio was just fine. I received the DVD in a very timely manner. I would consider this person a good seller! It was a good experience.  :)
Had a few more scratches than I would expect for 'like new', however the dvd played flawlessly and with this vendor's lightening fast shipping I would buy again with confidence.
Suprising for a used DVD but it works and its clean and not scratched.  I will buy more this way.
I recommend this seller because he delivered the product in time, even as soon as possible, and the product is perfect, just as described. Bravo and Thank You.
The Bottom Line:<br /><br />No one is going to accuse Gran Torino of being subtle and the performances by the neophyte Hmong actors sometimes aren't great, but the film is undeniably effective, with much more humor than expected (to be honest I laughed more in this film than in most comedies) a pitch-perfect performance by Clint and an ending slightly but significantly different than I predicted; it's not the greatest film Clint's ever made but it's a solid piece of entertainment.<br /><br />3/4
I imagine there are many war veterans in blue-collar America just as bigoted as Walt Kowalski.  But if Walt were played by a less well-known actor, the character's extreme one-dimensionality would probably have seemed more improbable than it does.  The picture is tolerable because I, like most movie-goers, am used to Clint's being Dirty Harry and making his points efficiently and with a minimum of subtlety.  Of course, the rest of the characters are equally cliched.  I will say that Clint's films seems more graceful at it than Charles Bronson's.  The climactic scene is a bit of a surprise, but I wonder what would have happened had the bad guys waited for Clint to fire the first shot.  I guess the message in all this is that we need to figure out how to accept the incursion of other cultures into our blue-collar neighborhoods.
Clint Eastwood played the role of Walt Kowalski pretty well, and the movie was good for the most part except for a few sappy scenes. Overall enjoyable.
All I Can Say Is, So I Don't Give Away What The Movie is About Is That I Did Not Like The Ending.
With both Asian and Polish ancestry and having grown up only an hour or so away from Detroit, I found watching "Gran Torino" a surreal experience.  Having at one time or another been called every vile term his Walt Kowalski levels with complete ease at his Hmong neighbors, I know the film ain't lying about the generally overlooked and often discounted racism against Asians in the U.S., but at the same time, I've never met anyone, let alone anyone Polish, with the unceasing vitriol that defines Walt's very existence.  In this, he falls into that narrow range of choices Hollywood makes for ethnic groups; if Italians must be gangsters and pizza makers or the Irish cops and bartenders, then Walt has to be the stereotypical racist, drunken, blue-collar Polack.  (He has plenty of company -- for starters, think Marlon Brando in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and Mickey Rourke in "Year of the Dragon.")  Oh, make no mistake, factory workers, including ones in my own family, could put away the beer, but Walt might well put two or three of these red-blooded guys under the table, even if I can't for the life of me remember any of them ever even contemplating reaching for a Pabst Blue Ribbon.<br /><br />But all this is understandable because despite its illusion of grit, "Gran Torino" exists in a gauzy fantasy space that allows suburban moviegoers to confront the real ugliness of bigotry, even their own, from a safe, artificial distance, like staring down that lion at the zoo that in the wild would be feasting on their bones.  Once again, Walt falls into another familiar Hollywood trope: the flawed white guy who must overcome his prejudices to help beleaguered minorities who can't help themselves.  Oh, and he's haunted by a war with Asians.  And his family is a bunch of jerks.  And he's dying, too.  If it sounds like I'm being too hard on "Gran Torino," a film that's wowed both critics and audiences, perhaps I am, but it's mostly because I truly like and expect more of Clint Eastwood, even moreso now that he's deservedly come into his own as a filmmaker with fare like "Letters from Iwo Jima."  Even here, he gives a performance that rises above the predictable story and hokey setups that too often mar the intent of "Gran Torino" to be taken seriously as a drama rather than a melodrama, and more importantly, a meaningful statement on racial harmony.  But I'm also struck by the nagging feeling that if it wasn't for the presence of Eastwood, playing what in many ways is a geriatric version of Dirty Harry, the same people lauding the film might not be shrugging at its mediocrity (and, no, I'm not referring to the sincere but sometimes uneven performances of his Hmong co-stars).  What's left are a lot of funny lines, mostly because of the brazenness of Walt's racism, a few touching moments between Walt and Sue and Tao, the two kids he will grow closest to, and an ending that's a "gotcha" you'll see coming from a mile away.<br /><br />Still -- and this is part of the surreality -- seeing an 80-year-old Eastwood sticking an M-1 rifle in a punk's face and snarling "Get off my lawn" is almost worth the price of admission alone.  It, too, is a cliche, but one of the few that the writers manage to cleverly turn on its head.
While I have been a fan of many of Clint Eastwood's movies for decades, GRAN TORINO seems to be one of his weaker films. Although its overall story arc of a bigot's change for the better (which permits him to perform a redemptive act) is genuinely moving and although there are at least a dozen excellent scenes (some touching, some humorous) showing him interacting with a pair of young Hmong neighbors (a brother and sister duo), this film also struck me as having lots of weak, flabby passages in its script.  Many repetitious and implausible scenes involving a stereotypically wet-behind-the-ears priest, an array of moronic, inept gang members, and the excessively obnoxious grandchildren of Eastwood's character should have ended up on the cutting-room floor. Similarly, many contrasting scenes affirming the overall wonderfulness of the refugee families are excessive and equally implausible.<br /><br />Many DVDs contain "deleted scenes" with a director's commentary explaining why they were cut. This DVD has no such extra feature; instead, it appears that everything scripted was filmed, and everything filmed was included--which is unfortunate.<br /><br />As a grumpy-old-racist-with-a-heart-of-gold, C.E. does a good job, and the issue of RACISM IN AMERICA is dealt with in a way that will (or should) make many viewers reconsider their own mindsets. I just wish the script and/or the final editing had been 20-to-30% better.<br /><br />Recommended with reservations.--David R. Eastwood<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT (11-22-10): DURING THE PAST YEAR, IT IS EVIDENT THAT bigotry IN AMERICA IS A FAR, FAR LARGER PROBLEM THAN MANY OF US THOUGHT. IN THE RUN UP TO THE 2010 ELECTIONS, CERTAIN LYING POLITICIANS AND CERTAIN BOGUS "NEWSCASTERS" BEAT THE DRUMS OF racism TO DIVIDE OUR COUNTRY FAR WORSE THAN IT HAS BEEN IN DECADES. SADLY, FOR OUR COUNTRY AND FOR ITS REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD, THEY WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL. --D.R.E.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Clint Eastwood and I are not related, and we have never met or communicated in any way.
THIS IS A DARN TOOTIN' GOOD MOVIE.  THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW............ WITHOUT AN ELABORATE FLOWERY DESCRIPTON ...."ENJOY".
I do not know if Clint is saying adieu in this movie or not.  I would tend to think that he is because most of his acting in it consists of trademark scowls, "make my day" confrontations and other stock Eastwood mannerisms. It some ways it is a parody of all his previous flicks. If Clint was to say "good bye" this movie does for him what the Shootist did for John Wayne.<br /><br />The general features of the movie overlap the Shootist in several particulars:  both involve a crusty old guy with a violent past, both center on the relationship that develops between that guy and a young man whom he effectively teaches to be a man, both have the main character ill with a terminal disease (apparently in this movie) and both move toward the inevitable show down which the main character knows he will not survive.  This movie has a lot more street language.<br /><br />Now, what I really like about this movie is its intentional, in your face celebration of masculine, pre-Political Correctness, pre-sensitivity, pre- just about everything else, grittiness.  Eastwood is making a statement here about what we lost when modern sensibilities have reduced male role models for young men to the artificial "either-or" of wimpish angst ridden pretty boys or mean, crotch-gripping gangstas.  There used to be more of a continuum in male-ness and Eastwood reminds us of an era when "being a man" had certain cultural connotations.  A man helps a little old lady when she spills her groceries getting them out of the car.  It also, as well, meantsnarling at a punk as you pushed a 357 magnum into his face in the act of rescuing a young woman that was otherwise an object of bigoted contempt.<br /><br />So, compared to "The Shootist" this movie comes in a distant second but not without its own merit and value.  It's well worth watching even if some of the scenes are a bit forced (the Barbershop scene with the kid especially).
Clint Eastwood is a powerful presence in this film, as Walt Kowalsky, an elderly Korean war veteran trapped in his hyper-masculine, racist, emotionally bared down persona. He is a widower, lonely, seeks refuge in his Gran Torino sports car and practical domestic tasks. He oozes growling, simmering fury at the invasion of his neighbourhood by Asian families 'Gooks, eggrolls, Charlie Chans'.<br /><br />The plot is a sort of grand redemption, road to calvary message as Walt finds himself unwillingly ensnared in the lives of the Korean youngsters next door to him, in particular Thao, a young man who initially tries to steal his car but emerges as a vulnerable youth in need of work and a father figure which Walt provides in his brusque, no-nonsense way (including a great scene where he educates the young Korean in savage, ball busting banter with his local Argentinian barber).<br /><br />As the tension develops, Walt, with his finger always metaphorically if not literally on the trigger of one of the guns he keeps in his bedroom, takes on a local gang of Asians with a much nastier tone than the ones in his immediate neighbourhood. He becomes a sort of white man protector figure, a chiselled, classical, superannuated hero who uses his old fashioned virtues to one last effect to save the new immigrant influx. The result is powerful, if a little simplistic, with bombast and symbolism overwhelming much subtlety.<br /><br />This film is noteworthy for being, supposedly, Eastwood's last screen role. And the finale perhaps gains a little resonance from that fact.
I enjoyed most of this film.  However, I agree with others that the film relies on contrivances and an unoriginal storyline.  It seems that the writer felt that the film had two possible ways to go:  One way could be the "Dirty Harry" route where Eastwood brilliantly gets violent revenge on the bad guys...Or, the other possible ending could be melodramatic with much hanky-wringing and a "message".  Neither option is appealing given the age and health of the main character...and the values he was trying to teach the young man.  There was a huge missed opportunity to tell a different story based on the certain realities that each of the characters must accept. This could have been a great film...Instead it's just more of the same.
Supposedly this is the last film Eastwood will appear in.<br /><br />Frankly I believe this because he looks like warmed over death (and it's not the makeup) and titers around the screen looking like he is going to tip over at any moment.<br /><br />He pulls from his quiver the usual gruff, no BS, hard characterization to play a recently widowed retired auto worker who finds his neighborhood, to his displeasure, largely populated with Moungs. There develops a relationship between him and some of his neighbors whom he slowly comes to like.  Alienated from his own sons he starts to mentor the boy next door who lacks a father figure and is under pressure to join a gang.<br /><br />Eastwood has made many many moves.  Some terrible in ever aspect, some well crafted.  Consistency in quality is not Eastwood's strong suit.<br /><br />The film is good, not one of his top efforts but worth watching.  If you like Eastwood's acting then this is a must see as it is apparently the end of an era.
Amusing to see Clint as such an overt grouch, he is usually<br />more subtle.  Rest of cast excellent, loved grandma!  The film's<br />main weakness is his ease of transition from racist hate to<br />adopting this charming family.  Overall, Clint delivers as usual.<br />Got this for my dad, who by the way, shares a lot of Clint's<br />characteristics, and just happens to be a huge Clint fan. . .
Clint Eastwood directed, produced, and starred as Walt Kowalski in this drama about life and death in a changing America. He's more like his character type than ever before. Kowalski is a snarling Polish racist, bitter retired auto worker, and haunted Korean war veteran who despises the Hmong "swamp rats" who've moved into the dilapidated house next door. The film opens with two clashing cultural rituals--the church burial of Kowalski's wife, and the strange Hmong customs that welcome a new baby. The film ends with another funeral that we never expect, this one the result of a deliberately redemptive act. Early on we surmise that the gruff and grumbly Kowalski will be won over by his Hmong neighbors. But there's far more to the film, as Kowalski can't stand idly by and not help the Hmong negotiate their own cultural obstacles, namely, Hmong gang members who try to recruit their son Thao. Large portions of this film are explicitly religious as Kowalski experiences a dramatic conversion.
This is an enjoyable movie, but you must be willing to suspend logic in many places, starting with the premise of the movie - that a local gang is so determined to get this kid to join them that they will do anything. Sure, he is the cousin of one of them, but he is also a wussy young kid. Why on earth would they want him hanging around? Heck, even if wanted to get in the car, it was already full. Whose lap did they want him to sit on?<br /><br />Then no matter what Walt/Eastwood does to the local thugs, from mouthing off to pulling guns on them to beating them up, the thugs never come after HIM.<br /><br />And when Walt gets to the porch with his gun in time to witness the drive-by shooting, he not only does not shoot at the bad guys, but he does not identify them to the police. Likewise, the girl who gets beat up does not identify them. Yes, it's been established that Walt doesn't believe in letting the cops handle trouble for him, but then ultimately, [SPOILER:] he leaves the fate of the gang in the hands of the police and the legal system instead of taking care of them himself. With any kind of lawyer, the thugs will not spend a day in jail. Walt was on their property, making threats, and as all the witnesses (who are suddenly willing to talk to the police) will testify, he made a fast motion as if going for a gun. If Walt was willing to die, a more Eastwood-esque ending of going in guns blazing would have made a LOT more sense.<br /><br />On the plus side, the casting was perfect. Sadly, the self-absorbed, greedy relatives were spot-on. However, a final directing flaw was the WAY too-long pause to build "suspense" during the reading of the will ("and the car goes to...................") while the camera focused on the grinning, greedy granddaughter.<br /><br />If illogical scripts don't bother you, buy it; otherwise, rent it.
Since I had heard this was Clint Eastwood's best movie, I was anxious to view it.  The story line was OK, but I just don't like the gutter language from the gang members, but I guess that's the only language they know.  They lack education and therefore vocabulary so what else is there for them to say in trying to have an exchange of communication with each other.  Glad I got a bargain on the price and didn't spend bucks at a theater.
Haven't had time to watch it, but like Eastwood movies and heard it had good reviews.
"Gran Torino" begins with a grim, crusty, bigoted Clint Eastwood (Walt Kowalski) who has just become a widower. Living with him must have been an act of penance for his devoutly Catholic wife. A very persistent boyish-looking priest in his late twenties has promised Clint's wife that he'll get the old codger to confession.<br />He has two sons and some grandkids who are self-centered, mean, and hateful, but they are also rubrics rather than real people. With a patriarch like Eastwood, it's little wonder they turned out so nasty.<br />He lives in a well-kept single family home in a nice neighborhood that's been taken over by Southeast Asians (Hmongs). Clint's prize possessions are an antique Ford Gran Torino (he worked on the Ford Detroit assembly line for many years) and an M-1 rifle from his service in Korea.<br />Over the years Eastwood's voice has grown hoarser, more gravelly, more strained and harder to distinguish. He's a dinosaur of the American film industry but still a national treasure.<br />The plot is formulaic, melodramatic and predictable. Eastwood is gradually won over by his Asian neighbors, especially the son and daughter next door. He becomes a mentor for the son and has to prevent the boy from becoming prey for the local Asian gang. Eastwood at first resorts to his guns with vestiges of his Dirty Harry image coming to the fore.<br />Eastwood has perfected a screen persona that is difficult for him to step out of. Even his walk is iconic. It probably would be better for him to let someone else direct a picture like this so it wouldn't turn into a star vehicle.<br />The ending is a surprise in a movie that needs a jolt of originality. It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either.
Before this movie devolved into clich&eacute;s and predictability, I really was enjoying the tale of a retired, archaic war vet trying to hold onto lifestyle and time period. It was really a great study into assimilation. Mind you this is all before Toad, i forget his actual name, said passionately? his first awkward line, "Excuse me Sir, I need a haircut if you ain't too busy you old Italian son of a bitch prick barber. Boy, does my ass hurt from all of the guys at my construction job."<br /><br />The movie never recovered, in fact, it got worse. I don't usually pay attention to acting in movies so when it manages to distract me from the movie's other elements, it must be pretty bad. The actress who plays Sue, while attempting to be intentionally funny, just manages to annoy the heck out of me. As the movie chugs along, albeit uncomfortably, Toad steals more of the spotlight. Maybe the director has some twisted sense of humor. An actor who steps out of character AFTER EVERY UTTERANCE should not hog the camera but should be hidden from it. After his every belch of "LET ME AOOOUUUT WALT, LET ME AOOOUUT NOW", he looks awkwardly around the room as though he's saying "that was good guys right? eh? eh?", proceeding to say "WALT LET ME AOOOOUUTT!".<br /><br />Thank god this movie had its share of memorable quotes +1 star.
Synopsis:  Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is an old-school Detroiter (read:  a white Detroiter who stayed in the city after 1967) and Korean war veteran who lost his wife to old age.  He's bitter with both his obnoxious family (who try to milk him for everything he has while providing absolutely nothing in return) and the world that surrounds him (which is crumbling away in a state of apathy.)  As Hmong immigrants start to populate his area, one such family moves next door.  The introverted son of the family, Thao (Bee Vang), is targeted by his cousin who goes by his gang name Spider (Doua Moua) who attempts to "make him a man" through having him commit gang-related crimes.  Thao is pressured to go through a robbery attempt on Walt's Gran Torino, only to be caught and nearly shot by Walt.  Spider attempts to rough up Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) when Walt comes out, guns drawn, and commands them to leave.  Indebted to Walt for sticking up to Spider, Sue grows an admiration for Walt while Thao is coerced by his family to "work off the debt" after dishonoring the family with his robbery attempt.  Though spiteful of Thao at first, Walt eventually starts to give him the type of guidance needed to discover his manhood.  However, Spider and his gang are insulted by Walt's interference and carries out acts of revenge against Thao, Sue, and their family.  Walt realizes that as long as Spider is around, their family will never rest and he's the only person who can stop him and his thugs from intimidating them...<br /><br />I wrestled with what kinda rating I wanted to give this movie.  In end, I felt it was appropriate to give the film 3.5 stars.  Here's why:<br /><br />Considering that the cast was composed of Clint Eastwood and a bunch of amateurs, the film actually turned out rather well.  It had it's funny moments despite the overall dramatic tone of the film.  Everyone committed to doing the best they could and carried through a certain human element that couldn't be replicated with an all-professional cast, so that was unique in contrast to many of the movies I've seen recently.  The dialogue wasn't pleasant or even remotely P.C., but it reflected the age of Eastwood's character in the film where people addressed each other as such (if you don't know ethnic slurs related to Italians, Polish, Blacks, Asians, etc, you're not gonna learn them here.)  I should also note the ending scenes of the film came as a surprise to me (save the very last one) and left you with the messages of justice through redemption.<br /><br />However, there was a enough that I couldn't look past to feel the film warranted a higher rating, and that had much to do with being a born-and-bred Detroiter who watched the film.  We're dealing with a city that's 82% black with an expanding Arab community, but featured a primarily white and Asian cast aside from three black teenagers and a car full of Hispanic gang members.  Anyone living near Detroit would also wonder why a Polish resident would live in a predominately black Highland Park while Hamtramck, the next town over, has a significant Polish community.  The plot devices involving Walt's immediate family were easy to telegraph from miles away and just reaffirmed the message that idle hands have nothing to show for their labor.  Also, the language in the film would have came as a shock at first, but eventually became stereotypical and tired by the time the film wound down.<br /><br />This movie might be viewed as a conservative movie, but I would recommend it to the NRA supporters and pro-justice crowd rather than the fundamentally religious.  I'd also recommend it to anyone who doesn't have any familiarity with the Detroit area because there's a good chance that the movie's charming moments would sweep you away.  I don't know if I'd put it in the same light as other critically acclaimed movies, but at the end of the day, it wasn't a bad film and I could see why many would enjoy it.  Feel free to check it out.
This movie is amateur in every way. Amateur production, amateur screen play, amateur acting, amateur character development.<br /><br />I'm sorry. Clint Eastwood has the right like anyone else to make a movie, giving new actors (including his son), screenwriters, and even musical and cinematographers a chance to be involved with a big screen production, but the chances are high that you'll end up with a film resembling something from theater 101.<br /><br />Show me sad timid Asian boy. (actor drops his head)<br />Show me angry, black wanna-be gangster. (actor uses slang and lots of profanity).<br />Show me angry Asian wanna-be gangster. (actor uses slang and lots of profanity with Asian accent)<br /><br />You get the picture...<br /><br />This could have been a great movie. It would have been a perfect opportunity to explore racial tension in a slightly different setting with different demographics, but with such sophomoric acting and production, it's just not there.<br /><br />Catch this one on cable or on a plane ride, but don't waste your time or money buying or renting this film.
I was not happy with this movie. The story was interesting. It might have been good but the language was so filthy and so pervasive that even some severe editing could not have saved it. The bad language seemed to me to be in virtually every scene and I believe that every character had a foul mouth. And there was a lot of violence. I would not recommend it and would not watch it again. My family member watched the whole movie, but I walked out because of the violence and offensive language. The reason I say that it was interesting is because my relatives verbally told me how the story developed after I walked out and also how it ended. The reason I bought it, was that my family member had borrowed it from a friend but lost the friend's DVD before it could be returned. I bought it as a replacement DVD so that it could be returned to the owner. Otherwise, I would never have spent money on this movie. On the other hand, I will say that the seller was fast and the cost was inexpensive. The DVD arrived quickly and was brand new in the shrink wrap as advertized.
It's hard to fault a man with such a distinguished portfolio of work as an actor or director, but "Jesus Christ" Clint you sure do know how to make a depressing movie.<br />  Can't say I like much about this movie, except for the dog.<br /> As dreary as the unforgiven.
Let's just say I expected a better story line and more action after seeing the previews.  However, action for a seventy-something year old man might be a little difficult.  I can honestly say that this movie wAs just ALRIGHT.
Okay ,Clint Eastwood is brilliant from all sides of the camera.<br />He also looks great for being almost 80.<br />The film has a great storyline.Its about an angry old man named walt who just lost his wife and no one cares that he lost his wife, The grandkids make a mockery of his wife's funeral and his son's just shrug it off and kind of think its puzzling that he is so mad at them.<br />He has every right to be angry,he has lung cancer and hates what is happening to his neighbourhood. a gang of thugs so vicious even the police are afraid of them  have taken over and rape,steal kill and destroy whenever they feel like it. The only who cares beside Walt is a pudgy, young priest who has no idea what he is doing.<br />So Walt starts taken care of things on his own,he also helps a wimpy kid get it together so he can make it in the world.<br />I had a problem with movie,Walt is a giant racist. Seriously, every other sentence out of his mouth is some derogatory word for Jews, Blacks,Koreans, Italians, and irish people.I can't put examples of what he says,because my review would taken off of here.I get that he is a racist, but you don't beat me over the head with how much of a racist he is,It really takes away from the movie.
Clint Eastwood is having a very good year. He may not have been feted at the Oscars, but massive box office is the best revenge. He directed Angelina Jolie to an Oscar nomination in Changeling (Universal; $29.98), the period film about a mother whose son has gone missing, only to find the corrupt LA police have tried to settle media hysteria by saddling her with another little boy and claiming this strange kid is in fact her child. Then Clint directed and starred in Gran Torino, a modest movie about a cranky old racist who finds he has more in common with his "foreign" neighbors than his own children. Remarkably, this tiny film has become the biggest hit of Eastwood's career as both an actor and director, with box office at $139 in the US. Yes, the year would have been perfect if Eastwood could have gone to the Oscars and crooned "Gran Torino," the theme song he wrote and performed with Jamie Cullum. I'm not a fan of either movie, unfortunately. Changeling is still-born. Jolie has a fee good scenes when she has to deal with the seeming imposter that the police have forced her to take home. But John Malcovich is miscast as a crusading preacher who wants to help her, fight the cops and loves the spotlight. He seems so slippery I kept waiting for him to betray her in some way. And what is the film about? Corruption? It spends too much time with Jolie. A mother fighting for her child? We can't quite figure out why she takes this kid in, however few rights women had at the time. And then it veers off into serial killer territory, making the film seem like three unsatisfying movies in one. All it made me want to do was rewatch LA Confidential. Gran Torino doesn't have half the ambition of Changeling but isn't even half as (un)interesting. Clint growls so much throughout the film he almost seems to be parodying himself. And most of the unknown actors he is surrounded with simply aren't up to the task. Why this particular film should resonate with audiences is a mystery (his biggest hit adjusted for inflation is the godawful Every Which Way But Loose). But clearly Clint has hit icon status -- if Clint wants to make a movie about a cranky old man sitting alone on a porch, Warner Bros. would be foolish to say no. And hearing Clint speak-sing parts of the song "Gran Torino" sent me back to one of his less-appreciated gems, Honkeytonk Man, the moving story of a dying country and western singer who gets one final chance to record some music. That's not in Clint Eastwood: American Icon Collection ($19.98; Universal), but four offbeat films are -- and at a bargain price. You get Eastwood's directorial debut Play Misty For Me, which made a respectable $10 million back in 1971 but which Clint told David Letterman he remembers as a box office flop which might have been his only time directing if the French hadn't championed it. You also get the so-so action film The Eiger Sanction, the fun Coogan's Bluff (which turned into the hit TV series McCloud and the very atypical Civil War flick The Beguiled, which has wounded Clint recuperating at an all girl's school. It's slowly paced and I hated it when I was a little boy in the hospital and that was the only thing on TV, but it has its fans and it's about time I gave it another shot.

Maybe the hype to this movie set up higher expectations. The acting was not that great and seemed forced at times. Walt seemed to have a change of heart way too soon, did not seem like a natural progression. One minute he hates the Koreans and the next he is out to save them. It would have been nice if there was more of a transition. The ending, while admirable was very predictable to me. SPOILER ALERT. It was so obvious when Walt went to confession and only had those two simple sins to confess...nothing about any vigilante killings he was about to do...you just knew that he was not going to do anything bad/illegal etc. When he was standing outside the gang bangers residence just blabbing away (risking be shot at any second) I knew again that he had no intentions on shooting anyone otherwise he would have done it right away and not risked getting shot first. You can see him setting it all up, dragging it on for more witnesses to see etc. It was an ok movie and I like Clint but it sure did not live up to all of the hype I heard.... The story line was very good but not executed very well in my opinion. Disagree if you wish as you are entitled to your opinion as well.. I know I am in the minority on this one but stand by my review.
I guess this movie wasn't trying to be funny, but it was a comedy for me none-the-less. After spending an hour of the film trying to convince us what a "hard-***" he is, Eastwood's character then begins to transform himself into something more "PC" before his death. Not that I'm in favor of gangs ruling neighborhoods, but let's face it - an army of crusty old white guys with bad prostates and bladder issues running around with guns in old 70's vehicles isn't the solution! I'm guessing the only people that might enjoy this film are seniors rather desperately trying to relive the prime years of their lives.
This is a somewhat interesting movie, although a little too pat in places. It's almost as if Eastwood placed himself at a carnival shooting gallery, with the bad guys popping up at predictable intervals for him to shoot down. The gang of hooligan Hmong teens pop up to try to roust their cousin to join their gang. Then they pop up to roust the young female teen in the family. As in Death Wish, there almost seem to be too many timed gang threats for the lead character to prove himself against.<br /><br />Then Eastwood's film children pop up in predictable, self-seeking fashion to urge him into the dullness of a retirement home. He shoots down these threats in turn - not with a gun this time, but verbally.<br /><br />There is also a certain predictability to the character that Eastwood plays. He is the gruff Archie Bunker bigot with a heart of gold. However, he does evolve, albeit again, a little too neatly on cue.<br /><br />But the film ultimately takes the viewer to some interesting places. And we learn something about the Hmong culture along the way. The Hmong are a group of Southeast Asian hill people whose story has rarely been told on the screen.<br /><br />There is no Director's commentary on this DVD, but there are a couple of bonus features centering on the 1972 Gran Torino that's the star of this film, and on classic muscle cars in general. Some of the men involved in the making of this movie and some others reminisce about their first cars and their dream cars. We get to see a Detroit rally of classic cars along Woodward Avenue in the process - an especially poignant parade since the Detroit scene has so altered in the months since this movie was released.<br /><br />With all these elements - insight into Hmong culture, classic cars, and a new dimension to classic Eastwood toughness - there are a number of reasons to check out this DVD.
In this movie Eastwood plays a geriatric bigot named Walt Kowalski who goes through a change of heart in how he regards and treats his next door neighbors in a gang plagued area. When harm befalls the neighbors, Walt takes the law into his own hands.<br /><br />This film is a bit of a throwback to Clint's Dirty Harry days with more sophistication. It's entertaining if you enjoy the catharsis of seeing the bad guys get their comeupance, albeit with more of a twist this time around.<br /><br />The film still felt rather heavy handed, with stereotyped characters (remember the first Rambo movie? Aside from Walt's grudging conversion, "Gran Torino" is basically populated with the same type of sharply delineated characters).<br /><br />It's also predictable. As soon as Walt gets the close shave and new suit, you can pretty much guess how the film will conclude.<br /><br />That's cool if that's is the type of movie you want to see. Some lifelong Eastwood Fans might call it a return to form.<br /><br />It's just that I was expecting something more along the lines of "Mystic River" and "Million Dollar Baby," where the characters were far more complex and the trajectories of the stories weren't as obvious, which made for compelling viewing.<br /><br />Finally, I know Clint likes to score his films, and his ususal solo piano or otherwise sparse arrangements support his movies well.  This time I think he channelled Tom Waits and sang through the end credit roll, and the result wasn't too pretty.
Not a good movie.  Not horrible, but Clint Eastwood plays the same tough-guy character he plays in every movie.  Predictable, unbelievable plot.  I couldn't finish it.
This movie missed a golden opportunity to educate the american people of the great sacrifice of the Hmong people and the ongoing genocide of these people for their fierce fighting along side of our troops in Viet Nam.
That's the ultimate question that living legend Clint Eastwood asks in "Gran Torino", thematically, perhaps the finest movie of his long and distinguished career. As everyone knows, Eastwood has aged beautifully as both an actor and director over the past 20 years, and both the timing and venue of his exploration of The American Character (either through planning, coincidence, or a bit of both) is impeccable.<br /><br />With the American economy in meltdown and the auto industry dented badly by foreign competition, retired Ford worker Walt Kowalski tries to keep both his cherished Gran Torino and his way of life intact as the ground shifts beneath him in a newly globalized world. With his wife (and most of his generation) having passed on, and immigrants (visible reminders of Kowalski's time in Asia) representing an ever-larger portion of an uneasy melting pot, Eastwood's newest "anti-hero" defaults to racial stereotypes as a defense mechanism (as do the street gangs representing various ethnic groups staking out their own turf). Then, suddenly, the neighborhood erupts, as does Kowalski's long-dormant soul, and there's no turning back.<br /><br />Trying desperately to preserve his way of life, Kowalski comes to accept that America's future will have a whole new face to it. Those willing to keep America great may not look like the men who fought alongside him in Korea, but they must be armed with the tools they need to rebuild their neighborhood, city, and country. Sizing up the personal character of his young Hmong immigrant neighbor who "doesn't have a chance" in warding off the advances of Asian-on-Asian bullying, Kowalski seeks to provide, both literally and figuratively, the personal equipment that this new American needs to successfully assimilate. Just maybe, in the back of his mind, this aging, crusty "Polack" remembers that, despite all the ethnic jokes tossed around among his circle, immigration has always contributed to the next wave of growth in America.<br /><br />With his soul stirring, Kowalski finally takes Confession, but he leaves unstated the biggest sin of his life: killing other human beings. For the relatively innocuous sins that Kowalski proffers, he's asked to atone with some basic Catholic rituals. But Kowalski has another method of atonement in mind, one that, for someone who professes to be not in the least religious, manifests a very Christ-like demonstration of selflessness.<br /><br />By the time Kowalski devises his plan of individual and neighborhood salvation, he realizes that "enemy" and "ally" cannot be pidgeonholed into ethnic or territorial classifications, just as the meaning of "family" is no easy thing to define. He understands that the model of living that he has preserved for so long must be torn up and that he must recalibrate how he views the world for the good of his soul.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is at turns a humorous, poignant, and searing movie with pitch-perfect acting by Eastwood, and an earnest and endearing cast of novice supporting actors. It is destined to be a classic. Even the spate of foul language - which accurately reflects the tone and sound of the streets like Kowalski's all across America - does not diminish the significance of this work.<br /><br />This is a muscle car of a movie that idles in your mind.
Clint Eastwood should have won best actor for this movie. I can't see why in the world Sean Penn won. Clint Eastwood is the better actor far and beyond Penn. It is one of his best. Only Clint could have pulled it off.
I should have saved Gran Torino for Father's Day, this coming weekend, and watched it together with my son, maybe as a double feature with The Great Santini. Looking over the reviews of this film here on the Big River, I find that the stars are closely correlated with the reminiscences of ornery old bustard fathers. Mine was one. In fact, my Dad looked almost exactly like Walt Kowalsky, Eastwood's character, at the same age. He dressed the same, walked the same, drank almost the same (slightly better taste in beer), and definitely hated the same. Only his accent was different -- my Dad's -- being a weird acquired country-western drawl on top of his still-Swedish pronunciation. He worshiped, like Kowalski, in the great American Church on Wheels; he was a car mechanic most of his life, and he had a Plymouth Barracuda that he cared for more tenderly than either of his two children. He was washing his car one afternoon, at age 91, when he had a stroke and died with the hose running. Neighbors found him a few hours later when the water started to flood their yard. Those neighbors were Salvadore&ntilde;os rather than Hmong, as in Eastwood's film, but the neighborhood dynamics were equivalent.<br /><br />Some critics have 'explained' Walt Kowalsky's bitter racism and self-hatred as the consequence of his experiences in the Korean War. Eastwood himself expresses that through his character's mouth and through the starchy dialogue between Walt and the young priest who tries to 'understand' him. Honestly, I don't think the atrocities of war were necessary to create a Walt Kowalsky. My father was of an age to have fought in WW2, but he didn't. He dodged, and the rest of his life he did his best to pretend he hadn't. In the '60s, he "disowned" me - temporarily - for refusing service in Viet Nam. I see this exoneration of Walt Kowalsky, as a victim of PTSD, as a slight weakness in the concept of Gran Torino, a too-easy excuse for the racism and xenophobia of "our" fathers' generation(s).<br /><br />The most touching moment of Gran Torino comes when Walt murmurs that he feels more in common with his g**k neighbors than with his upwardly-mobile sons and their families. That's not a unique perception. Garrison Keillor has expressed it time and again in his Lake Wobegon sketches. Farmers in Iowa, according to NPR, have been finding themselves sharing more with their hired Guatemalan help than with their college-gone heirs; they end up selling the farm to the newcomers and staying on as guests.<br /><br />But my own father never had Walt Kowalsky's epiphany. Tragically, he remained a ranting rightwing racist till the end. The virtue of this film -- this re-examination of 'Dirty Harry' by the actor who made "dirty Harry' an iconic figure -- is Clint Eastwood's powerful affirmation of a new integrated America, the land where diversity and assimilation can be reconciled. I wish all our fathers had gone that route.<br /><br />Artistically, cinematographically, Eastwood's performance in the role of Kowalsky is the only five-star feature of Gran Torino. The script is no masterpiece, and the other actors range from "not bad" to "well, I've seen worse." Clint Eastwood is his own most iconic story, from his spaghetti westerns to his comedy surliness to his current confessional maturity. I wonder who has the film rights to produce "The Eastwood Chronicle" when he dies...
If watching a film over and over again is any indication of a great story, this one merits such praise.<br /><br />Always playing a quintessential American, he repeats such a performance here as a recently widowed retiree and Korean war veteran who resents the HMong Asians that are taking over his neighborhood. His well-kept home and mannicured lawn adorned with an American flag represent his values, and stands as a beacon in a neighborhood that is being overcome by neglect and overrun by gangs. Wanting to be left alone, his contempt for customs, dress and language of his neighbors is palpable in word and facial expression. He shares almost as much contempt for his neglectful sons, and his granddaughter whom he despises for her dress and lack of manners.<br /><br />A strange relationship develops when he finds out one of his neighbors attempted to steal his pristine, 1972, Gran Torino that he helped build in his assemly line career at Ford Motor Company. The boy's mother insists he make restitution for the family's honor. The man who just wants to be left alone is drawn to the would-be thief and the family he disdains. We see him as a curmudgeon who pays them compliments with insults such as "I could use some good gook food," when invited for dinner. In fact his character, Walt Kowalski uses all of them under the Sun (Yat Sen).  Yet, their respect for such a disrespectful man grows, as he takes the boy under his wing and becomes the protector of the rest of his family.<br /><br />This is where Eastwood's performance soars. He appears to be in constant conflict with his prejudice against his sense of justice and fair play. He goes over the edge when one of the family members suffers at the hands of a local gang. Justice must be served and sacrifices must be made. Their mutual devotion replaces the lack of the same with his own family.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has delivered such memorable characters as Dirty Harry and Josie Wales with great lines such as, "Go ahead; make my day" and "Dyin's not much of a livin'." Like a good wine or scotch improves with age, Eastwood becomes equally memorable as a director. When he directs and acts, it is topnotch entertainment from a very simple story of a complicated human being. His supporting cast is also superb, and this film may launch future careers to prominence. The score, if you can call it that, is mellow and almost haunting.<br /><br />There is not a dull moment in this film in what starts off as a seemingly bland plot. With a penchant for a wandering mind for average stories, I was not only transfixed watching it, but watched it two more times to pick up nuance I might have missed. I was never bored.<br /><br />I don't think you will be bored either. Order it here, or drive to your nearest outlet to rent or buy it, even if you don't have a 1972 Gran Torino to get there.
I had seen "Gran Torino" when it first came out in theaters: however, I took a second look at this film when it came to DVD, because my initial impression kept haunting me.  I have to say that I liked this movie very much.  I liked the story, a lost young man looking for his place in the world finding a mentor in the most unlikely of characters.  Filmed on location in Michigan, Clint Eastwood, directed and stars as a crusty widower, Korean vet, detached from his adult children and their family's, living out his days in a neighborhood settled mostly by Hmong people.  Newcomers to the screen are fledging actors, Bee Vang and Ahney Her, plus an appearance by Clint's son, Scott Eastwood has the small part of Trey (as Scott Reeves).  This movie is about change and values, about knowing who you are, and who you want to be.<br /><br />Walt uses just about every racist term he can think of in this film.  His new neighbors consist of an Asian family consisting of a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's two children, Sue and Thao.  One characteristic between Americans and just about any other race is the matter of family.  Walter Kowalski, his two sons, moved out long ago, rarely visit, sits alone on his porch all day drinking beer and eating beef jerky.  On the other hand, his Asian neighbors have family and friends constantly visiting, bringing food and having family celebrations.  The movie focuses on Thao and his sister Sue as second-generation immigrants trying to find a niche in this country.  Thao, around 16, living in a female dominated household, content to read and garden, activities considered in Asian society as woman's work, is visibly lost.  His sister Sue, a few years older, describes their environment concisely, "the women go to college the boys, go to jail."  Matters worsen for Thao when his cousin, Spider approaches him to join his gang and receive protection from the other gangs.  The initiation to join the gang is to steal his neighbor, Walt's 1972 Gran Torino.  Thao botches the auto theft and runs home.  Too dark to see who was trying to steal his prize, Walt is unaware that it is his own neighbor, Thao.  The next evening, Spider and his gang come to give Thao another chance, but the boy's sister, mother, and grandmother interfere.  Spiders, gang of dropouts try to take Thao forcibly.  In the midst of the ruckus, Walt, armed with his army issue M1 Garand comes out Dirty Harry style and saves the day.  As the reluctant hero to the Hmong community, his neighbors shower him with gifts of flowers and food, arriving on his porch daily.  Sue, her mother, and Thao insist that Thao repays Walt for trying to steal his car by working for him.  Reluctantly, as Walt does not want anything to do with these people, agrees to the work arrangement and the two of them begin a journey together that make this an excellent movie.  The other character to watch for is Thao's sister Sue, although a stronger, smarter character than her brother, she too is a victim of her environment.<br /><br />Right away, the acting of two supporting characters will come in question.  I say the supporting cast played their parts strong, and added a depth to the story, the human element.  Bee Vang's portrayal of Thao at times seems awkward, out of place and lost.  Teenaged boys, growing up without a strong male role model, are awkward, out of place and are certainly lost.  Bee Vang is a natural for this part.<br /><br />Like the Dirty Harry movies, the Spaghetti westerns of Eastwood's early films, or even Pale Rider, or "the Unforgiven," this movie stands out for the journey that each of the character make toward finding themselves.  Walt, Thao, Sue, Sue's grandmother, Father Janovich, and even Spider and his gang.  Each of the characters, making this journey of self discovery ties together throughout the movie by one thing, Walter Kowalski's 1972 Gran Torino.  The 1972 Gran Torino that Walt installed the steering column as it rolled out of the factory.  The Gran Torino that Thao attempted to steal, the Gran Torino that is the envy of the town, the Gran Torino that Walt's inconsiderate granddaughter asks for when he dies.  The Gran Torino that Thao must wash as part of his penitence, the Gran Torino that Walt allowed Thao drives his first date to the prom.  In the reading of Walt's Last Will & Testament, the Gran Torino does not go to his granddaughter, Ashley, who is an insensitive brat.  Instead, Walt gives the Gran Torino to Thao.  The Gran Torino gives Thao the opportunity for a new life.  The car, like Walt is an antique, a reminder of the past.<br /><br />I wanted my kids to see this movie in spite of the swearing and racial slurs.
I don't think I've ever heard so many racial slurs in a movie, but dang, that was good. I loved Eastwood's hard-nosed character and how he wouldn't take crap from anyone, and whipping Thao into shape and helping him down a better path. The ending was rather bittersweet but appropriate.<br /><br />If my own family was like that (talking about taking me to a retirement home on my birthday!!!) I'd be the same way towards them. The poem 'Do Not Go Into the Good Night' came to mind when I finished watching this film because of Eastwood's character and his toughness. Overall great movie, 4.5/5 stars.
This is a state of the art film.It,s amazing how eastwood seems to be better than ever.In few words it's a "Gran" story and a "Gran" movie. Thanks Clint for the wonderful moments you gave to me.
Well, it wasn't what I expected. I really enjoyed this movie and found myself watching it several times to get all the dialogue from it. The characters were well portrayed, gangbangers were spot on. I used to know someone in my neighborhood like Clint's character.<br />I really enjoyed the girl Sue's character who was strong. Also nice to see a movie that isn't always politically correct, the real world isn't always like that. Not really a big action flick but was a nice change.
This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be! It had a great storyline, good message, some funny moments, and some heart-breaking moments. Clint Eastwood was awesome as Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran who is very cranky, grumpy, and racist. He lives in a neighborhood dominated by poor Asian immigrants and infested with gangs. A young Hmong boy named Thao Lor who agrees to an initiation which requires him to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino, but Walt stops him. Walt finally befriends Thao's family, and tries to help Thao become a man, and learn responsibility. When a Hmong gang threatens the Lor family, Walt knows what he must do. I highly recommend GRAN TORINO!!!
This review is for; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZ6F2">Gran Torino (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><br /> As a life long Clint Eastwood fan watching "Gran Torino" stirred up memories of Dirty Harry, Sgt Gunney Highway from "Heartbreak Ridge" and any other similar characters that Clint has done throughout his illustrious career in his iconic, "Eastwood" style. A style complete with his trademark raspy voice, angry-eyed stares & straight to the point, but sometimes humourous dialouge.  Set in a Detroit neighborhood we learn that Eastwood's character Walt Kwolski has just become a widow. A decorated veteran of the Korean War he has two sons, but he isn't close to them nor their families. His grand-daughter talks to him about what is going to happen to his possessions when he is going to die. His son & daughter-in-law talks to him about going to a retirement home. He also hates the Toyota SUV his son is driving as we learn Walt used to work at the Ford factory. "Buy American" he curses! I'm not from Detroit, but I heard import cars are sometimes frowned upon there since American cars are produced by the big three American manufacturers in Detroit.<br /><br />With the look of frustration he continues to live alone with his dog. He has immigrant neighbors that he initially despises, but ultimately gets drawn to them after a local gang encounter with the family's son Thao. The same son that attempts to steal Walt's prized 72 Gran Torino from Walt's garage but fails. Walt becomes a neighborhood hero and is showered with gifts of plants or food by his neighbors that he initially refuses. Thao's sister Sue, befriends Walt and he returns the favor by rescuing her from three men who threaten her & her very, scarred boyfriend. However the very shy & reclusive Thao becomes the interim student for Walt, as Walt sort of takes him under his wing and attempts to make him more of a man by teaching him. His dialogue lesson in the barber shop is one of the greatest and funniest moments in the film, which helps him immensely for his next encounter during the construction job interview. Walt still periodically communicates with his son's family with little or no success (his son's attempt to give his father birthday presents were funny to watch!), but it is the immigrant family that Walt really bonds with in this film as they are the true focal point for Walt. We also learn of Walt's impending sickness that may very well influence him for what he decides to do in the end.<br /><br />This is a coming of age film for the character Thao and a redemption story for Walt who despite his severed relationship with his sons & their families finds solace with another family he initially despises but learns to trust & love towards the end. There are many racial slurs spoken throughout the film as well as profanity, but the kind of language you might hear from street gangs anyways. Actually, every time Eastwood spoke with profanity, he always made it sound funny! The film climaxes to the eventual final confrontation with Walt & the terrorizing gang. Without revealing what really happens in the end, the results were satisfactory. This is another great Eastwood film that goes up there with "Unforgiven" & "Million Dollar Baby". Although I think "Gran Torino" should satisfy more of the Eastwood fans that enjoyed the type of character Eastwood portrays from his Dirty Harry movie series or a similar character from "Heartbreak Ridge". Classic Eastwood at his best!<br /><br />Oh yeah & the next time someone gets on my front yard, I will give them the iconic Eastwood stare & say "Get Off my Lawn!".
Being a huge Clint Eastwood fan, I expected a lot more action than this film had. I knew basically what it was about, but again, not enough action, and truthfully, half the time I was waiting for something to happen, but it didn't. There was far too much sitting around staring at the neighbors to suit me, and the film was much too long to say what it had to say.  I might have liked the film better if the ending would have been a bit more upbeat, at least. But, I guess, I should have expected it after it became obvious that Eastwood's character had health problems and something had to be done to bring the bad guys to a closure.
This item was what I ordered; although, it did not specify "widescreen" when I purchased it and I would have preferred full screen.
After all the great reviews about Clint Eastwood's performance in Gran Torino, I was really disappointed in the end result. Eastwood is one of my favorite actors and I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  Playing the neighborhood crank ("Hey, get off my lawn"), in a neighborhood gradually changed around him; he is bigoted and ornery. Dealing with the death of his wife and the realization that all his neighbors are Hmong refugees, he is one angry old man. The problem is credibility. Eastwood's use of racial epithets doesn't seem to effect his neighbors one bit. Calling them every insult imaginable for a person of Eastern descent evokes smiles from the neighbors, except Grandma, who wastes no time telling him off. I thought I was watching "Walter", the Jeff Dunham character rather than Eastwood.<br /><br />The gradual shift from hate to a point where Eastwood actually gives his life to save the neighbor's kid is a powerful story line, but lost in the stereotypical way Eastwood acts (or fails to). I just don't think this movie lived up to all the hype. On a minor note, the Gran Torino in the title and mentioned significantly in the trailers is barely a plot line in the movie. Yes, he did help assemble the car; yes, the neighbor did try and steal it, but other than sitting outside and polishing it occasionally, it is not central to the plot at all. Sadly, this is one of the DVDs that I purchased that will most likely sit on the shelf without a repeat viewing for a long time to come.
I thought the acting by Clint Eastwood was a bit contrived and over the top. There were too many racial slurs and slangs which made me feel uncomfortable at times.  Just too much name calling!  The filming was a bit dreary, it was depressing to watch.  The climatic end was touching but it left me feeling empty.  There hasn't been a really good movie released in over a year, what's up???
Despite a lifelong spent watching Clint Eastwood play many different parts, while I expected this film to be very good, in truth it's merely average and so it disappointed me.<br /><br />In my estimation, "Unforgiven" is Eastwood's best film.
I pre ordered this movie months before it came out. I ASSUMED it would be delivered on the day it was released. I was wrong. I received it 3 days after release. Not only that! I paid $15.99 plus shipping and handling. I could have bought the exact same movie at Target on RELEASE DAY and only paid $10!!! In fact, it's STILL only $10 at Target! Live and Learn! Don't buy new releases from Amazon!
"Gran Torino" is an emotionally satisfying, cathartic revenge movie of the Clint Eastwood genre. Clint stands up for the little guy against a bunch of bullies, the bullies retaliate brutally against Clint's weaker friend (Unforgiven?), after which Clint goes on the warpath and gives the bad guys their come-comeuppance. This type of movie is no less powerful for being predictable. Gran Torino is different in a couple of ways though. Firstly, in its characters and its setting, it has more texture than most movies of its type. Clint is the last White man in his once clean and safe Detroit neighborhood, now dominated by Hmong and blacks and is having a hard time dealing with the transformation. This is a situation that I don't recall being depicted by Hollywood before, and it is portrayed with great realism and grit. Secondly, this movie is different in that Clint's ultimate vengeance doesn't involve massacring all the bad guys, but in setting up his own murder so that the thugs are all arrested. So what's the problem with this movie?<br /><br />Clint's character is the victim of a historic injustice. In a neighborhood, a city and a country that he and his people built, he is now a stranger, living in a sea of criminals and parasitic foreigners imported into America by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 Immigration Act. The Democratic Party, with the cowardly complicity of the Republican Party and the ideological support of media and academia, have flooded America with non-White immigrants, to the point where Whites will be a minority in the U.S. by 2030. We didn't invite in foreigners based on their skill sets or personal character. So long as they were not White, it was ok with the Left so long as the hordes  undermined the dominance of Americans in their own country. The revolutionary and historical implications of this are obvious. No nation in history has ever voluntarily committed suicide. No nation in history has ever chosen to be conquered. Indeed, Americans never voted to give away our country to others, but that's still what's happening. We know what the Left called it when 19th century White men moved into African or Asian countries and took over the government. They call it colonialism, aggression, ethnic cleansing and genocide. When it's happening to 21st century White people in America and Europe, the Left calls it "diversity" and "multiculturalism". The implicit, and explicit, message of our Marxist masters is that White people need to die. Our continued existence is a bitter reminder of what America used to be: White, proud and strong. Therefore, we need to give away our neighborhoods, our cities, our country and our classic cars to our black, brown and yellow superiors and just die, while rejoicing in our destruction.<br /><br />It bears noting that this movie was written by a man named Schenk and produced by men named Gerber and Lorenz, along with Eastwood. Somehow, I think we'll be waiting in vain for a movie advocating the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees, extolling the glorious diversity that they would bring to Israel.
Oh, boy, was this movie offensive.<br /><br />I'm not even talking about the rampant Archie Bunker-esque racist remarks coming from the mouth of angry old Mr. Kowalski, either. I'm talking about the fact that this was yet another movie in a long line of movies in which the non-white characters bumble through their lives as utter childlike idiots with no clue how to live, until a white man comes along and sets them straight.<br /><br />The fact that it was up to this man to teach Thao (whose name Mr. Kowalski wouldn't even pronounce correctly, and everyone was fine with that, including Thao and his family) how to be a "MAN" really angered me. Did Thao just step out of a big white balloon? Does he have no other adults influencing his life? We know that his father is dead, but I distinctly saw other males in his house during the ceremony at the beginning. That's implying that there is, in fact, only one way to be a man, and that way is to be abrasive, assertive with women, use tools, and be quick with the ethnic slurs and the profanity. Wow. Just wow.<br /><br />Speaking of the ethnic slurs, why are they okay? Why does no one call him on them? Sue even jokes with him about how her family doesn't eat dogs, only cats. Why does she do that? Why are they seen as something almost noble, an art form?<br /><br />Thao also talks about how he couldn't get a job. Why not? It's not explored. It seems to me that it's not explored because it's not seen as important. We see that Thao is quiet, meek, and likes to garden, but we don't see anything else. He is not really a character in the movie, rather a means to an end. He's just there so he can be saved, transformed, and so Mr. Kowalski can be redeemed through him.<br /><br />His sister Sue fares little better. She has more to do, but it's abundantly clear through the movie that since she is just a girl, she too will need to be saved, or avenged. It's just ridiculous. She starts out as a strong character, but ends up as just a victim. The gang member cousins dismiss her as just a woman, and so does the film.<br /><br />Indeed, the only character with any development is Mr. Kowalski. Yes, Thao supposedly became a "man", but I didn't see much difference in how he behaved throughout the movie.<br /><br />It could have been really good, and parts of it are very entertaining and funny. The part where Walt is in the Hmong family's basement, has no idea what to do, and ends up fixing their washing machine, only to have no one notice, was hilarious. I think the depiction of the ungrateful family who wants Walt's house and car were very well-done and realistic. And I admit, it is a pretty good redemption story at least in theory, but I keep forgetting it takes place in 2008 because the ideals are so dated. I honestly have seen episodes of "Jonny Quest" that are less blatantly racist, and that's a cartoon from the 60s.
Betty, I know you are going to hate me for this, but I have to be honest here.  This movie was just horrible.  It's hard for me to put into eloquent words all of the missteps this poor little film made, because part of me just feels like rambling off a list of bad decisions.<br /><br />First, I'll lay out the plot.<br /><br />Walt is a bitter and grumpy old man who is an unapologetic racist dwelling in a community overrun by those with which he has hatred for.  His family has all but written him off, and this visibly irks Walt.  When his neighbor, young Thao, attempts to steal his Gran Torino (as part of a gang initiation), Walt finds himself in a situation (with individuals) he never foresaw.  After inadvertently saving Thao from the clutches of his cousin's gang, Walt is further introduced to Thao's family, and despite being hesitant he begins to warm to Thao after he officially apologizes.  Walt then has Thao become his `handyman', putting him to work around the house doing odd jobs here and there.  Things seem to go well for the two, and a bond is formed, but if we know anything about gangs we know that this will not be the end of things.<br /><br />The story felt VERY clich&eacute;d and it didn't really try to compensate for those obvious generalizations.  Some make remarks like "this is far better than `Crash'" but in the end they are both rather embarrassing reflections of racism to be quite honest.  I'd like you to explain to me HOW this is better than `Crash'.  I won't say it is worse (although I gave `Crash' a C, my feelings for that film have dropped considerably), but it is hardly better.<br /><br />So let's take this apart, shall we.<br /><br />I'll start with the script.  Like I said, there are clich&eacute;s that pretty much mount one on top of the other here, from the formulaic way in which Thao's family is represented to the ridiculously generic way that Walt is presented to us.  There is nothing genuine about his character.  Everything feels pulled from another performance or character developed in an Eastwood movie.  This is Eastwood playing Eastwood.  He is grumpy, and everyone knows it, and his family has distanced themselves from him (who can blame them) and yet we are supposed to feel an urge of sympathy for him because he overcomes his racism and befriends Thao and his family?  I found the scene in the barbershop with Thao to be rather ridiculous too.  Yes, this is the type of guy that Walt is, but it's nothing to feel all chummy about.  The way the film ended I thought was (somewhat) clever, and then it went all Hallmark sentiment with the final frame, which I found a tad squeamish.<br /><br />How about the direction, since that is what Eastwood is all about?  Honestly, this film lacks tremendously in that regard.  Now, for all of you out there (yes, you MKIA) who think that I am an Eastwood hater and that I'm blowing this out of proportion, realize that I gave `Million Dollar Baby' an A+ and still highly regard that film (and it's direction), not to mention an A for `Unforgiven', and despite not caring for it collectively, I gave pretty high marks to `Changeling' as well.  This film though, is just poorly constructed and realized.  The direction is very stagy.  Look at the scene when the family is worried about Sue and she comes in the door, and Walt drops his drink.  Watch how the camera zooms into a closeup of the drink, telling us that Walt is going to drop it before he does and then, what does Walt do...he lets go.  It's not a `disoriented slip through his fingers' drop, it's an `open my hand and make a statement' drop.  It just feels fake.  Decisions like that one give this film an air of unnaturalness that ruins any connective tissue.<br /><br />But, the acting takes the cake here.  Casting `non-actors' is kind of a vanity thing for a director, but in the end there are moments where it works.  This is not one of them.  Bee Vang has to carry about as much of this film as Eastwood (we'll get to him in a minute) and so he needed to be more authenticated.  I love how one reviewer makes the statement that while Vang comes off wooden, "there is no substitute for authenticity."  Sorry, but that wooden quality strips the performance of authenticity.  He's obviously trying too hard.  Eastwood, like I mentioned earlier, is just playing himself.  Yes, the script is at fault for handing him a caricature (I don't care what you say about his character arc, it just boils down to a mess of generalities) but Eastwood doesn't put any real life into it.<br /><br />Snarling and growling and looking all mean and stuff is not really emoting, like at all.<br /><br />In the end, this overcooked film is just a mess.  I'm sorry Betty, I know you love your Clint (and I won't hold that against you if you don't hold this review against me) but this film is just plain bad.  Maybe the whole racism subject should just be left alone, since no one can really seem to get it right (is it just me or was this another one of those `white guy saves the day' kind of message films), but then again it is a potent subject that has potential to really create something poignant.<br /><br />This is not poignant.
I'm not crazy about this movie. I think the best part of the whole movie is the ending. When Walt leave's his house to the church. Instead of his son's family. They don't deserve that house after the way they were to him. I'm also happy that he gave his car to that chines kid instead of his granddaughter. She also doesn't deserve anything,
The critical reviews of this Clint Eastwood film had been all over the board, so I watched it with hope but no special expectation.  Nothing could have prepared me for how awful this movie was in every regard...right down to inane "special features."  Eastwood is a hell of a director when he wants to be.  I can't imagine what attracted him to this After School Special script with its one-note characterizations and by-the-numbers plot development.<br /><br />There is nothing to recommend in this movie, but much to condemn, including atrocious acting by the supporting cast, including the priest and most especially the police officers at the end, who turned what should have been, in a good movie, a dramatic ending, into farce.<br /><br />Not a single subtle, genuine emotion to be found in the movie, the apotheosis of awfulness was reached when Eastwood looks at himself in the mirror and says that he has more in common with these [profanity profanity racial epithet...if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, be aware that every fifth sentence follows that form] people than I do my own family.  That's how little trust the script and direction had in the storytelling--the need was felt to smack the viewer right in the face with the point of the story.<br /><br />Finally, a word about the special feature...on cars.  Yes, the movie's title is "Gran Tarino," and that's a car, and Eastwood's character had worked in Detroit making cars, and the car is in the movie in a couple of key scenes.  But this is not a movie about cars.  The eponymous wheels are if anything a symbol, but to have a feature about cars attend this DVD makes about as much sense as having a feature on sledding in a "Citizen Cane" DVD.<br /><br />I can't wait for Eastwood to return to form.  He is a smart director and a talented actor.  Fortunately, this is a rare misstep for him.  I can see why he was attracted to some of the messages in the script.  But the clunky, clumsy storytelling is nothing if not Unforgiven.
Clashing cultural values, inner city troubles, and Clint Eastwood.  Sounds great, and it should have been a phenomenal movie.  Unfortunately, the dialogue was embarrasingly poor, and the acting made me laugh at inappropriate moments.<br /><br />The story is powerfully important, but the script/acting got in the way.  Too bad.<br /><br />Verdict:  Watch the trailer, then skip the movie.
This movie is about the importance of collecting valuable possessions over your lifetime and giving them to who you think is most deserving. Clint Eastwood did not think his family was worthy of his car or the valuable set of tools he accumulated over 50 years, so he gave them to the Cambodian family from next door because they gave him food. I thought the whole ordeal was very shallow and unnotable.
Seriously, can you believe this insipid film?  At best, it's a good episode of "CHiPS" -- at worst, a bad episode of "CHiPS".  And what horrid acting, all around!  Hard to actually see Clint's heart growing bigger, but you know it did. Well, you assume as much.  Don't you?
Here we have Clint Eastwood back in action, albeit at a more geriatric pace, giving his all in the role of a disillusioned, grumpy old geezer, having to  tolerate all the unpalatable social compromises that the modern world has imposed on him.  Where once he lived among his own folk, he now is surrounded by immigrants from the orient, with all the physical dilapidation that entails.  His one abiding passion is his somewhat unremarkable Gran Torino (GT) car - a survivor, like Clint himself, of better times.<br />All this is fine as far as it goes, but when he switches momentarily into the tough guy role, he somehow comes over more as a tough old fart than anything else.  This is really stretching things a bit far.<br />In fact, bearing in mind that Clint Eastwood, good as he has been in many roles, is not the kind of versatile actor that, say, Jack Nicholson is, does not really carry the character off with the same panache as Nicholson did in "About Schmidt." There you had a slightly similar idea of a "senior citizen" bearing all the inconvenience of age on his back, but with infinitely more subtlety and humour than Clint achieves. Whereas Schmidt was wholly believable and touching, Clint's character left me cold and unconvinced.<br />If, however, you are a diehard Clint Eastwood fan, you won't be disappointed - as had been amply attested by most opinions on the film. It has a decent story line, well concluded, but for me it lacked conviction.
In short this Gran Torino blu ray movie other than being super clear and sharp, nothing else is great. The story line is simple and boring.
A surprisingly shallow way for Clint Eastwood's cinematic career to draw to a close, Gran Torino may have been better served with a more thick-witted title, something along the lines of "Bitter Old Man Points Guns at Minorities." Not that there isn't fertile ground for exploration along these lines; Eastwood's isolated, closed-minded widower could have been an excellent vehicle for prodding a number of inherent stereotypes present in modern American suburbia. Instead of meeting those issues head-on, though, it spends most of its time stalking up and down the sidelines and, often, reinforcing the kind of bull-headed resistance to different cultures that, at the outset, it seemed ready to confront. I had a hard time accepting any of this film's main players as anything more than thin caricatures, especially considering the bland, straightforward dialog they're given to work with, and that resulted in a major emotional disconnect during the climax. Eastwood's jaded war veteran never seems to move completely beyond his biases and, shamefully, the film's resolution only serves to prove him right. A plodding, incomplete picture that will only be remembered for the single quotable line heard in its trailer.
Inane Story.  But this film shows the harmful reality of contemporary American multiculturalism.  Multiculturalism that is promoted as inevitable and good by the prevailing know-it-alls in American media and government.  Open gates of immigration are not requirements within the American formula.  There are limits to everything.... the immigration standards of limits were exceeded long ago to the detriment of existing Americans.
Eastwood, even in his old age, still has it. But he obviously needs better supporting actors/actresses around him. I'm not sure if he randomly picked these people out of a box or off the street, but c'mon.
'Gran Torino' jest filmem przeznaczonym dla entuzjastow pestek slonecznikowych, dlubanych na zywca. Pozostali, oprocz najbardziej zagorzalych fanow Clinta Eastwooda, moga z powodzeniem odpuscic ten dwugodzinny niewypal. Rezyser filmu, Eastwood, gra tu role kultywujacego swoja odrebnosc i skloconego z siasiadami zgorzknialego weterana Wojny Koreanskiej, ktory w zaskakujaco szybkim tempie morfuje w kierunku zawzietego sasiadoluba. Film zrobiony jest bardzo wprawna reka i zawiera kilka smiesznych tekstow, ale ku mojemu rozczarowaniu przewaza w nim zgnilawa atmosfera "politycznej poprawnosci", czy tez kulturowego bon-tonizmu.<br />Byc moze jest to ostatni film Clinta Eastwooda, gdyz jego "znaki dymne" sa tu nie do przeoczenia. Pozwole wiec sobie na oficjalne podziekowanie temu aktorowi i rezyserowi, jednemu z moich filmowych idoli, za jego wklad w tworzenie bajki dla poznania ktorej chce sie czlowiekowi wstawac z lozka, wbrew zdrowemu rozsadkowi.<br /><br />Hotel Detective
Clint Eastwood does a wonderful acting job, but the minority actors he hired for this film are truly horrendous.<br />They were so bad it kept taking me out of the moment for what would have otherwise been a fine film.<br /><br />Clint, what were you thinking in hiring these people?  They were worse than what you might expect from a really bad junior high play.
I waited and waited for this movie to premire on Blu-ray because I thought that I was going to see Eastwood in a revised character of SFPD. I was so totally disappointed with the fact that a man this old used his money to be able to re-live his American life by drudging up all the nasty names ever used by people in this nation to show their hatefulness and disrespect for other Americans. This was a total waste of my money. I could have tuned in to the Fox Talkshows or listened to Rush Limbaugh for this experience. Once again, there must be real hatred in the heart of Clint Eastwood because time has taken away his prized America that won't allow him the luxury of feeling superior and legal permission to stand out in the streets and spew his disdain for fellow Americans. I hope this film gave his the outlet that he so desparately seems to need to show minority Americans how he really feels about them all. It equaled his speech at the Oscar awards many years ago. To me, this film was an insult to be stowed away like BIRTH OF A NATION.
HORRENDOUS- What can be seen on our streets/in our schools every day...why pay for/be'enertained'by/ this???
I hadn't heard a lot about 'Gran Torino' prior to renting it.  I do know that it received some critical acclaim and that neighbors who saw it liked it...but that's not surprising considering it's a Clint Eastwood Joint.  I love Clint, but everyone loved 'Mystic River' and 'Million Dollar Baby' (more like 'Million Dollar Boredom') and I thought those movies were boring as hell.<br /><br />Let me say before I swiftly bash this movie that Clint Eastwood is arguably the greatest of movie stars.  This guy has been in more classics and played some of the terrific characters to ever grace the silver screen.<br /><br />My guess is that this will be his last starring role and maybe that was what he intended when making it.  It doesn't really end the way most Eastwood films end in that he kills just about everyone in his path.  Maybe this is just a metaphor for a 'dying movie star', so to speak.  The way Harry Callahan or Philo Beddoe or Blondie would have handled these situations...well there would be some bodies left behind and/or a lot of people severely beaten left in his dust.  This isn't a bad thing, but the message I got from the ending was that Clint is showing us that he doesn't have to use his guns or fists as he rides off into the sunset as a motion picture actor.<br /><br />'Gran Torino' isn't really much of anything, really.  I can tell you that the script is appallingly bad and the acting by absolutely everyone involved is even worse.<br /><br />It's grumpy old man who hates everyone befriends neighbors he despises because he opens his heart up when they leave flowers and chicken dumplings on his doorstep.  Perhaps those relationships would be more entertaining and believable if ANYONE in that house next door could act a lick or was remotely likable.<br /><br />The first hour and twenty minutes are a complete and total bore and you will be asking whoever is unfortunate enough to suffer through it along with you, "What the hell is this movie about?"  At least something actually takes place in the last twenty minutes of the thing, but the closure is a major disappointment.<br /><br />I don't know if this is supposed to be about what Rocky Balboa told all of those Soviets in 'Rocky IV' about "If I can change and you can change, EVERYBODY can change" or what...but it was very, very bland, boring and horribly acted.  It would be a better story if he finally found good in some people upon opening his mind/heart and actually spoke to his children every once in awhile, but that whole scenario is just tossed under the door mat.<br /><br />I hate to think that this could be (and probably is) Clint's final starring role.  He's probably my favorite 'movie star', but I'm not going to bow down for him just because it's him like everyone in Hollywood seemed to do upon this release.<br /><br />Just say no to the Gran Torino, ya dig??
Disappointing tale from Clint Eastwood. Clint plays an grumpy old racist who learns to love his next door immigrants. Yeah, it's just as bad as it sounds. I have to say, I thought the first half was absolutely HILARIOUS! Clint's character was just so over-the-top, I figure it had to be camp/caricature. The way he comes up with new way to insult everyone? And goes around growling like a dog? Too funny! (And here's hoping that it was supposed to be funny, otherwise the movie's worse than I feared.) The second half of the movie really goes downhill, and becomes a kind of 'Karate Kid' in reverse (this time, the adult is American and the kid is Asian). The lone bright spot of the movie is the teenage girl who lives next door - she's a firecracker, and the movie is better every time she is on the screen. But otherwise, this is boring and predictable, something you don't usually get from Eastwood.
I cannot rate this DVD as it does not work.  I've heard this movie is excellent.  I wish I could find out how to return/exchange.
I received the DVD quickly but when I went to play it on my computer, it would not play. Very disappointed.
This is a deranged hybrid of five characters/movies:  Bloodsport (the flashback sequences), The Karate Kid, Dirty Harry, Unforgiven, and Jack Nicholson's character in As Good As It Gets.<br /><br />Eastwood's character is a retired Ford employee in a Michigan suburb that has undergone "white flight."  He's the lone Caucasian surrounded by Hmong immigrants, has just lost his wife, and the kids he can't stand can't wait to get him out of his house.  A neighbor kid tries to steal his prized Gran Torino as a gang initiation.  The kid is a loser and unworthy of being a prospect, but logic has no place in this movie.<br /><br />Eastwood catches him and shortly ends up saving him from the gang, in front of the kid's family.  The family wants the kid to work for him to erase the shame of his crime.  Eastwood loans him out to the neighborhood, teaches him skills (including how to swap ethnic slurs with a barber), and outfits him with tools.<br /><br />When the gang beats up the kid and takes his tools, Eastwood knows he has to confront them.  He does so in a manner befitting a war veteran who knows what it means to kill and doesn't want to again.  Since Unforgiven was also highly overrated in my opinion, this introspective nonsense plays just as well in this film.
Not sure why people like this movie. It's one giant stereotype/cliche with really bad acting and bad script.
I wish I never bought this because it was a big waste of money.  My daughter said that I would love it and she was wrong.  I definitely should have rented it.  Personal preference, I guess.  I'm sure some people thought it was great.  Not me.
Not what I had expected from a Clint Eastwood movie. The characters were wooden, the plot predictable, the central character a cliche. Not worth renting.
this movie was a downer.  bad things happen to people and to the star.  would not care to watch it again.  i purchased it because of media hype.  Clint Eastwood is a top star and actor.  but the movie left me very unhappy.
What a disappointment.  It was dull and predictable from beginning to end.  Four movie lovers watched this together, all fans of Clint's more recent work.  We were all sadly disappointed.  We can't figure out what others are seeing that we all missed.
This is the second worst movie that I have ever seen (First place goes to Mamma Mia). It was boring and the script was clearly written by a man or woman who has never lived in a mixed-race neighborhood, because it was clear that he/she had no idea what he/she was talking about.
THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY A BOOTLEG DVD.  I HAD JUST SEEN IT IN THE THEATER, AND WHEN I GOT IT TO SHOW MY INVALID FATHER WHO CAN'T GO TO THE MOVIES AND LOVES EASTWOOD, THE PICTURE WAS SO DARK YOU COULD HARDLY TELL WHAT WAS GOING ON,  THE SOUND WAS SO MUFFLED THAT MY DEAF FATHER COULDN'T GET ONE WORD.  SO THIS WAS A TOTAL LOSS FOR ME AND THE NICE SURPRISE I WANTED TO GIVE MY OLD DAD.  IT ALSO TOOK ABOUT A MONTH TO RECEIVE IT. I GOT SKUNKED.
I purchased this DVD because I so love Clint, but...I was really disappointed ,the acting was so bad, characters unknown, and down-right embarrassing! And, then I recall another movie Clint was in: Bronco Billy, and that sucked also....i do not recommend wasting you time or money on this movie!
What a disappointment! Too many bad words to dodge, if you mute out the potty-mouth, you don't get to hear the movie at all. Soooooo not worth the time to get to the impotent finish. No satisfaction of watching the bad guys get emasculated and see regret fade into pallid death... I rented it for a $1 and it wasn't worth the money! It's Hollywood; it should end the way I want it to. However unrealistic, "Dirty Harry" made us feel good. I hope this isn't indicative of Eastwood's final years on the screen... fade to black.
Another morbid downer from kinky Clint. Vain, bitter old man, disappointed in life and especially his family, sort of gets to know his foreign neighbors and uses their problems as reason to die. Are you cheered up yet? A movie about a man who's learned nothing made by a director who in my opinion has learned nothing, except how to stay weird enough to keep Hollywood interested. This movie is an absolute zero in my book. I got sucked in by the reviews that this was a really great Clint performance. Wrong. Just a lot of silly profanity. Save your money, and skip it.
All I can say is my Love for Clint has been tested.<br />Words like "cracker" "hunky". Did Archie Bunker write this?<br />The slang was dated, obviously from his Dirty Harry days.<br />Clint lines were the only ones delivered with meaning.<br />The other "actors" sounded like they were rehearsing for a school play.<br />The fondation was set, but nothing but nonsense was built upon it.<br />The over zealous Father from the church was laughable.<br />The Mhoung gang was funny as well.<br />We found ourselves laughing at inappropriate times.<br /><br />PRO: NOT AS AWFUL AS SPIKE LEE'S MIRACLE AT ST ANNA.
To this day I still do not understand the praise this movie gets! I get what the movie is trying to do.  I get the whole racism, old man in a new world, coming to terms with yourself...blah blah blah.  Those things are all well and good if they are done in a halfway decent fashion.  First off the acting is on par with any Soap Opera on TV.  I could barley sit the through the thing because of this.  I think I actually felt vomit touch the back of my throat trying to watch this movie.  Second the whole story is just corny as hell.  This is pretty much it "Grumpy - Racist old man hates the world...takes sissy Asian kid under his wings...finds peace ".  The last thing that really made me want to slit my own throat was the scene where Clint is so shocked that he drops his shot glass.  It was so over dramatized....I can't even stand to talk about movie.<br /><br />Do you self a favor and skip this Over Hyped piece of garbage!
When Clint Eastwood deals with Church, ethnicity, justice issues, and stars in his own show the results are always awful. This film is no exception. In this film's conclusion, with the Christ- cruciform pose, nothing registers,,it's kitsch.<br /><br />Thank God for Independent cinema; when will this kind of pseudo -dramatic nonsense cease?
As a longtime Clint Eastwood fan, I've watched this movie numerous times since I bought it, and it's astonishing that a man almost 80 years old can make a movie THIS good.<br /><br />I know people not even 50 years old laid up sick on dialysis, and Eastwood not only made a movie of this depth and direction, but also STARRED in it, which is amazing to me.<br /><br />No person in film history has starred and directed themselves in as many movies as he has.<br /><br />He's one of a kind.<br /><br />Having said that, unless they plan on bringing out another edition of the movie, the special features were lacking.<br /><br />Just a couple of features about cars.<br /><br />Strange, when you consider that the car is only peripheral to the real plot of the movie.<br /><br />Virtually nothing on the origins of the project, and how the film came to fruition. No behind the scenes visions as the film was being made. Not even the movie trailer is included.<br /><br />But, my five stars are for the the film ITSELF, which is a testament to Eastwood's indelible career.<br /><br />It's a travesty that this movie not only didn't WIN any major awards, it virtually wasn't even nominated for ANYTHING.<br /><br />One nomination from the Golden Globes and NOTHING from the Academy.<br /><br />Ridiculous.
Loved this movie ever since i saw it on the big screen. Its wonderful that they included a digital copy of the movie because I can watch it on my computer.(mac/windows)<br />The audio is truly flawless, but i must admit, I have a 1080i Sony 32" and so I cannot view a 1080p, (what blu rays are viewed best on) however I had no complaints with the visual quality of the film.
I usually am not a big fan of Clint Eastwood or the movies he makes and that's why I waited so long to see this one.  That was until I started hearing EVERYONE saying how great it was.  From my little sister to my elderly grandfather and all in between...they all said it was one of the better movies they have ever seen.  With the credits on the screen now rolling, I agree.  It's one of the finer movies I've seen at least this year.<br /><br />The only thing I would tell people going into it is beware of racism.  Pretty much any and all racial slurs are used in this movie.  It didn't bother me because that's how it is.<br /><br />Also a special spot in my heart is that this was in part filmed in and near Detroit, where I live.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor, shell out the money to buy it and do just that....buy it.  Watch it, love it.  You won't be disappointed!
A very good Clint Eastwood movie, sad ending though even if he outsmarted the bad guys.
This is a very good movie that everyone can enjoy. The acting and the characters are good. Even my ten year old thought this was one of the best movies we saw this summer. Not alot of action but a very deep character that Eastwood does a great job with.
Well done Mr Eastwood sir, excellent movie all the way through.<br />Raw edgey and a great storyline.<br />More please.
Gran Torino (2008) is a movie that is so brazenly anti-p.c. that I am surprised it was even made.  The movie shows the reality of gang warfare and the futility of trying to stand up to these thugs.  The epithet hurling Eastwood finds he has more in common with the hard-working and tradition-based Hmung than with the sniveling whiners who make up his own family.  Eastwood's character takes on the young boy "Toad" and teaches him important lessons.  The best scene in the movie occurs when Eastwood appears with a gun and tells the gang of street thugs to "Get off my lawn!".  It shows real attitude.  Anyone who has ever stepped out of the ivory tower long enough to witness the operations of these types of gangs can certainly appreciate this.  Ultimately the film features an epic showdown in which Eastood must take on the gang harassing Tao's family.  There is little left for him but to be put into an old-folk's home by his own superficial and parisitic family or to go out fighting.  As always, Eastwood chooses the tough guy's way.
One of Clint's best roles and best performance.  Tightly directed.  Very powerful and moving.  Should get Oscars for best picture and actor.
I really am disgusted with the Oscars for not being able to recognize a film like this or Valkerie in the same year. Unbelievable. Clint Eastwood's perfect film. It brings all the toughness, tenderness, suspense, and humanity of any of his other films and crystalizes them into a work of art everybody should see.
Clint Eastwood is probally the only man in his late seventies that could probally kick your arse. Let's face it. He's still a force to be reckoned with.<br />One of cinema's greatest Tough Guy actors and the heir apparent to the mantle of the late John Wayne, Eastwood has carved a unique niche in cinema history.<br /><br />This film almost plays like an updating of the character he portayed as Dirty Harry Callahan in the 70s. A tough, hard edged man who was politically incorrect and did morally questionable things but seemed to always get the job done ,whatever that may be.<br />His character is a war veteran who has just lost his wife. Besides still mourning demons of his violent past he must contend with severe loneliness brought on not just by the loss of his wife but by family alienation. His two sons seem to have no love for him and only use him. His grandkids, ditto. He has several predjudiced reservations about his own neighborhood as several Chinese immigrants move in that recall in his mind the enemy that he had fought and had warped his soul so much.<br />To make matters worse, his street is surrounded by violent gangs that wreak mayhem for no discernible purpose. The cousin of one of the local gangsters has moved in to him next door. He's a young and shy kid who through fear and peer preasure is forced into attempting to steal Eastwood's Gran Torino car. The kid instead faces the barrel of Eastwood's M1 rifle!<br /><br />Interestingly, this is really where the film begins. Eastwood unintentionally becomes connnected to the family next door and learns something of there culture and is looked upon as a hero. The young man is ordered to work for him to erase his debt from the attempted theft and he becomes mentored by Eastwood. In many ways, Eastwood has discovered the family he never had. Unfortunately, his world is being threatened by escalating violence and this leads to a powerful resolution and the defintion of true heroism.<br /><br />Eastwood has always been known for making complex and interesting films and this one is no different. It's a surprisingly fast paced and short Drama that nonetheless remains more touching and memorable that virtually most films released today. It's a film that questions not just the concept of a hero but the concept of how and why we need them. It also is one of the few films to offer such biting commentary on the general apathy of today's generations with it's lack of morales and petty materialism. This is certainly NOT a Hollywood picture.<br /><br />Clint's acting is just abput as good as it gets. Only an actor of Eastwood's level of charisma could make such a racist and mean spirited character so loveable and funny. Eastwood's confrontations with the gangs throughout the picture are certainly highlights and are as fun as we'd expect. The film also offers Clint an opputunity to reflect on the right of violence, sort of like his Will Munny in 1992's "Unforgiven". His confession to a young Priest in the film and his ultimate sin and life regret is one of the actor's great screen moments and sums up the message of the film beautifully.<br /><br />Eastwood is supported by a fine cast including newcomer Bee Vang as "Tao", the youth who attempted to steal Clint's Gran Torino who becomes very much like his "lost son". His scenes with Clint are both humorous and moving. Christopher Carley's role as an insisitent young Priest also hist the right note and he plays off of Eastwood surprisngly well. Ahney Her is cute and likeable as the older sister of Tao and she is able to be one of the few people whos is able to empathize with Eastwood's cantankerous character.<br /><br />This film is overall incredibly well directed and acted while remaining consistently entertaining. First rate cinema all the way and a perfect bookend to the career of one of America's most significant artists. Truly great and one of the best films of this decade.
We all have gotten to know Clint Eastwood through his handiwork.  The countless early Western TV shows and movies he starred in introduced him to us.  His role changed from Star to Superstar in his epic depictions of "Dirty Harry," the hard boiled Inspector of Homicide.  Since those days, we have seen his excellence as a director in many more excellent dramas and Westerns.<br /><br />Although controversial, we peered into his morality and sense of caring above and beyond the cultural senses of morality in Million Dollar Baby.<br /><br />And now, at the age where you would think that Dirty Harry would be merely lolling in retirement, drinking his beer and smoking his cigarettes on a front porch, Clint Eastwood directs and stars in a movie where he IS in retirement drinking beer and smoking cigarettes on the front porch, snarling at everyone, his neighbors, his war experiences, and his own family!<br /><br />In Gran Torino, he shows that it is possible to teach an old dog new tricks.  Ever steeped in hatreds, bigotries and racial stereotyping, he is slowly changed by his Hmong immigrant neighbors.  As he takes a young teenage Hmong under his wing (although in the beginning it was done to protect the only thing he truly loves, his vintage, mint condition 1972 Gran Torino,) he steers young Thao away from the aimless Gang-bangers and "Mans" Thao up.  (Accordingly to his learned, inherited flawed standards.)  While doing so, he discovers that on the human emotional side, he truly has a lot more in common with the Immigrant Ethics than he has with his own kin!<br /><br />As "Walt" softens and learns to appreciate the Immigrant's generosity and hospitality, we see the true heart of our "Dirty Harry."  He has more purpose in life now than just hating everyone and loving his Gran Torino.  When young Thao is "man enough" to go on a date, Walt even lets the young man (who preciously tried to steal his True Love) use his Gran Torino to take the young girl out on a date in style!<br /><br />And when the neighborhood gang threaten and try to kill the immigrant family, Walt lets out the Dirty Harry in himself, and sacrifices himself to protect the people who have adopted the "crusty old bastard" as one of them!<br /><br />Walt's last request was to give Thao his Gran Torino.  In the last scene when we see Thao driving Walt's old Gran Torino, the car with the grille that scowled like Walt used to do, the joy on Thao's face reveals that not only is Thao driving Walt's soul. but Walt's soul has been transplanted in young Thao!<br /><br />If anything that Clint Eastwood has done in this movie that is worthwhile is this:  To show how, in a changing America, that by embracing and celebrating the diversity in this country we all strengthen what this country is all about in the first place!  "One among many,"
It's been interesting to observe the evolution of "Clint Eastwood" over the years. Some of us remember him as far back as his "Rawhide" days, and journeyed with him during his "Spaghetti Western" and "Dirty Harry" eras. Eastwood's company, "Malpaso" was formed in the late 60s and "Malpaso Productions" in the late 70s. It's from that era on, I've developed a true admiration of his work and that brings us to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZ6F2">Gran Torino (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><br />It's important to say upfront that "Gran Torino" is not about the car - only what it symbolizes. "Gran Torino" is not an easy story and Walt Kowalski (played, directed, and produced by Eastwood) is not an easy or necessarily likeable man. In some ways, the character much reminded me of Al Pacino's "Lt. Col. Frank Slade" in "Scent of a Woman." The words "curmudgeon," "obtuse," "hard-boiled," and "bigoted" are just some of the descriptives. Kowalski has just lost his wife, is ill, is not happy with his life, with the world, his own neighborhood, or himself.<br /><br />Kowalski is especially vexed by his next door neighbors - who are "Hmong" immigrants, and a young priest (played by Christopher Carley) who is bent on watching over Kowalski. The priest, who looks ten minutes older than a middle school student, means well, but thinks he has invented the answers to life. At least, at the beginning.<br /><br />Then we add local gangs and their machinations into the mix and Kowalski finds himself in the position of defending his Asian neighbors. He is still resistant to friendship, but gradually the young boy Thao (Bee Vang) and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) get under his skin.<br /><br />It may be a cliche', but this is a "coming of age" story for many of the characters - including Kowalski when he makes an irrevocably final sacrifice in defense of the Asian family. Kowalski, in his own way, grew with one giant leap of selflessness.<br /><br />Like much of real life, this is a pretty tough story to take, but it leaves us with a sense of hope and the potentiality that people can change.
Man, its just hard not to like Eastwood films!!  Ever since Play Misty for Me, Clint's directorial projects have consistently been high-quality films.<br /><br />This is probably my favorite Eastwood project - it is multi-layered, affectionate, surprising, and thoroughly engaging.  It makes a pointed and very necessary statement on racial attitudes in the US today.  Moreover, it is an equal-opportunity statement - eventually NO ONE escapes the wrath of Walter Kowalski.<br /><br />Clint portrays an embittered war veteran whose racial attitudes strangely enough seem to come more from popular stereotypes ingrained in his head rather his own personal beliefs.  For me, it seems he is more upset that time has wrought such dramatic changes in his life - he has not had the time or the inclination to catch up with those changes.  He is also in a vulnerable place.  He just lost his wife, his relationship with his sons leaves much to be desired, he has little patience with religious ideas(or so it seems) and he is not well at all for the new racial fabric of his neighborhood.  He DID cherish his wife/marriage, his service to his country, and it appears his only current pleasure is his prized possession, his Gran Torino.<br /><br />Without giving away too much of the plot, suffice it to say, he eventually "modifies" his attitude through his involvement with an Asian family living next door.<br /><br />The ending is indeed touching and heroic and quite frankly, beautiful. Strangely enough, however, it seemed disconcertingly like the conclusion of Dirty Harry rather than Walter Kowalski -  this makes it all the more sadder yet infinitely more gratifying.  Clint was just wonderful as Kowalski and the actors portraying Sue and Thao were equally impressive.<br /><br />This one, I'm sure I'll watch over and over again. I hiiiiiiighly recommend.
This film ought to be watched a good deal more.  Clint Eastwood has done what Gary Cooper also did in High Noon--given Americans a lesson in what democracy can and ought to be and in the shallowness of our Hollywood-created desires.  Eastwood as Walt Kowalski ends his role in the movie with a prayer--a Hail Mary--and he allows himself to be shot up so that the Hmong community can come together as a vibrant part of the American community.  His (Walt's) death, like the death of decent American factory jobs, is not in vain if others take it up and use it well.<br /><br />The need we have to reign in our vengeance and our violence is acute.  The need we have to support each other while our jobs are being sold and destroyed is acute.  Eastwood has given us a film that begs us to go back and figure out how to make America stronger and more committed to justice and equality and dignity.<br /><br />Well done, sir.
In what promises to be Clint Eastwood's valedictory role as an actor he once again reimagines the Man With No Name-Dirty Harry persona so that's so burnished in our collective psyche.  Walt Kowalski(Eastwood) is a retired Ford worker who can be best described as grizzled, profane, and just a little bit Archie Bunker-ish in his worldview.  Not the least bit misanthropic he feels more of a connection to his '72 Gran Torino than he does his own family.  Dig a little deeper, though, you find a man bearing the scars of his service in the Korean conflict.  Walt has an ingrained perception of the American dream but finds that being challenged by the changing face of his Detroit neighborhood particularly his reaction to the Hmong family who live next door to him.  Through a series of events, though, Walt developes a connection daresay a deep-rooted respect for the Hmong. Walt also feels, even in his dotage, the obligation to serve as protector to this family in an ever increasing hostile environment.  I harken back to "Unforgiven" when Eastwood re-evaluated his Western persona.  Here, Eastwood does a re-examination of his more reactionary film characters.  This film was cleverly advertised by it's makers as a geriatric action extravaganza.  For sure justice is meted out in the end but not remotely in a way you would think.  This film definitely stands out in the canon of Eastwood's illustrious career.
One of my all-time favorite Clint Eastwood movies.  Very impressed with the whole movie and Blu Ray adds the extra touch.  A must see movie.
This is a great story with a lot of themes.  It contains racism, bitterness, accountability, kindness, heroism, and redemption.  And that is just in the main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood).<br /><br />Walt is a cantankerous Korean War vet who is a recent widower.  His next door neighbors are a Hmong extended family.  A teenage boy in the clan, Thao (Bee Vang) is being pressured heavily to join a street gang to which his cousin belongs.  He is resistant, but eventually succumbs.  As an initiation rite he is required to steal Kowalski's prize possession, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino.<br /><br />In typical Eastwood fashion, he is a heroic tough guy even at 78 years old.  He stops Thao from stealing the car.  Eventually he takes the lad under his wing.  The story of inter-generational friendship between them is strong and very well done.<br /><br />This is really a great show.  The language and racial slurs are a bit rough so it is not a good one for younger viewers, but it is a very good one for the adults.
This is a remarkable movie. --Richard T. Jameson, taken from the product review<br /><br />If you are Clint Eastwood, you can make a movie how it should be made. As grand, iconoclastic Dirty Harry, Eastwood stood up for those who would make America better and stronger. As Walt Kowalski, he fiercely faces down a neighborhood gang and rescues young Thao, brother of Sue, his sassy new Hmong friend and neighbor.<br /><br />This is the point where Eastwood becomes Walt--racist, mouth filled with racial epithets spilled forthrightly on the objects of his racism. But it is not a purposeful racism, just one of habit and habitat. As with any meaningful exchange with those different from us, he begins to see that the Hmongs are people--and Americans, as he is, but in a different cultural context. It is actually liberating for Walt to make this connection (he doesn't have one with his sons and their families).<br /><br />My first thought after seeing this movie was disappointment mixed with respect. "Gran Torino" did not produce the thrill I expected, but instead delivers compassion and redemption and sacrifice, inestimable values in the big picture of Life. Ol' Walt had more in common with the priest's boss than first meets the eye.<br /><br />I wondered why Eastwood specifically chose Hmongs to be his neighbors (were they initially scripted in?). Developing genuine concern, compassion, and finally affection for his neighbors, Walt shows how Archie Bunker could have been 20 years down the road of American cultural dynamics.<br /><br />This, I thought, was Eastwood's purpose. America is changing; let's acknowledge it, accept it, and embrace this change. How my heart swelled with respect and fondness for this new icon--a Walt embracing his own mortality by acceptance and finally redemption.<br /><br />This is a remarkable movie--<br />Judy Polhemus.
A superlative achievement, Clint Eastwood's "Gran Torino" (2008) charts new territory for the legendary actor-director while continuing his cinematic winning streak. The fact that Eastwood made this film and the powerful "Changeling" in the same year is nothing short of astonishing. Just when you thought Clint had retired from acting, he emerges with another classic portrayal as a redemptive veteran in a changing urban landscape. Hollywood rarely gets it right these days, but Eastwood delivers the goods. "Gran Torino" represents the movie icon at his absolute best.
Eastwood continues to amaze making films as good as this one in the latter stages of his career. He doesn't rely on sci-fi gimmics or CGI, just the nuts and bolts of great movies: story and acting. This movie is no exception. It's a very good story about an Asian family moving into a run down house in a deteriorating neighborhood next to a very hardened old S.O.B. of a retired auto worker. Bigotry ensues, gang activity follows and under the masterful direction of Eastwood, a great film is born. Don't miss this one!
There are some very good and lengthy reviews on here for this movie... so I have nothing further I could possibly add to the review; I just wanted to write this bit so that I could vote and give it a 5 star review. It is that good.
If you haven't seen this movie yet, please go rent it today. Don't read other reviews, just rent this. Since I wrote this review, there are only 13 reviews that are three stars or below. The rest of the 123 reviews are four stars and above. That should tell you something in it's self. This was one of my first Eastwood movies as an actor I've ever seen. I'm happy I picked this up. Within five or so minutes I was already hooked to Eastwoods character and the film. I didn't look away for a second. The film should not bore anybody. The film is not a comedy but there were many funny moments. The story had a deep meaning and I'm sure everybody can learn from this movie. Everybody needs to see this movie. Tell your friends and don't sit around, rent it today. Enjoy.
If this is truly Eastwood's final acting role then he has gone out on a high note. This is classic Eastwood.<br /><br />Mix equal parts William Munny, Harry Callahan and Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Highway and you get Walt Kowalski. Love him or hate him it was hard working authority respecting men of his caliber that made this country what it is...was? If you are ultra sensitive as so many are these days you might take offense. My wife is Chinese and she took no offense.<br /><br />I didn't look for any hidden meaning or high moral. I just loved the story, the acting from all parties and the over all feel of the film. It has the solemn approach of Million Dollar Baby and allot of subtle humor as well as lines that cause you to burst out laughing.<br /><br />We saw this in the movie theater and I picked my copy up today. Definitely worth owning and seeing again.
This was one of the best films of the year. The humor in it is a bit raw, so if you are easily offended you might want to steer clear of this one. But if you like things that are not politically correct than this film might be right up your ally. Maybe the story is a bit "Hollywooded" up, old man set in his ways, young boy reaches out, blah blah, you get the idea. But it still was a very entertaining movie anyway. To me, this was one of Eastwood's best efforts to date.
Fitting end to a great American actor's big screen career.  This movie takes you on a rollercoaster ride of deeply personal emotions and will make you CRY to see how it ends!!!  ANY movie that can do that, most certainly deserves FIVE STARS!!!
Gran Torino is one of the best movies I have ever seen!  Clint Eastwood is a genius with his fantastic portrayal of a racist old man that you cannot help but love, this movie makes Eastwood a legend in my mind.  All the other actors and acresses were fantastic and I was in awe at how powerful the movie was.  I can't express how great this movie is.
If you are not moved by "Gran Torino", something must be wrong with you.  We share Walt's journey from curmudgeon to redemption with both laughs and sorrow.<br /><br />I disagree with criticism of some of the actors being wooden.  Think about it, how many of us really converse as if we were living a glib, prelearned line, Hollywood dialogue.  We hesitate, gather our thoughts, and continue.<br /><br />There are several call-backs from Eastwood's previous characters.  "Get off my lawn" is delivered like Harry Callahan's "Make my day".  He spits tobacco juice like Josey Wales.  He snarls like Will Munny. He delivers "F**k me" like Ben Shockley.  Walt is my favorite Eastwood character, as he is a compilation of Eastwood's best.<br /><br />The Detroit urban blight is captured as "Gran Torino" was filmed on location in and around Detroit.  My hometown (Lansing, Michigan) is much the same as Detroit, this is a movie about people and places I know.<br /><br />Open your heart, open your mind, and let "Gran Torino" wash over you.  You'll be glad yo did.
This movie is so great in so many ways, I could not possibly write a review that would do it justice.  Get it.  Watch it now, 6 months from now, a year from now, 10 years from now... You'll get something new from it every time.<br /><br />I thought Clint Eastwood peaked with Unforgiven, but I'm glad to see that I was wrong.  Still, I hope this isn't the last we'll see of Clint Eastwood.  I'm still hoping he'll do a "retired Dirty Harry in an old folks home" movie.  A predictable setup where Dirty Harry is now in an assisted living facility that gets robbed and harrassed by some neighborhood punks, so he rallies the old guys for some geriatric revenge using some of that unpredictable Dirty Harry style.  That would be a RIOT!
Gran Torino begins and ends in a church. In between is a tale of bitterness, reawakening, revenge, and ultimately redemption. In other words, this is a Clint Eastwood film.<br /><br />Gran Torino is a very well done movie, made by one of the most effective directors in Hollywood; if it covers some familiar ground, it is also a departure from this turf. In control on both sides of the camera, Eastwood plays an embittered Korean war veteran, Walt Kowalski, whose wife has just died as the film begins.<br /><br />Even without his wife's death, Walt could never be accused of being a happy man. He resents his changing Detroit neighborhood and the influx of minorities, personified by the Hmong immigrants who live next door to him. He resents his two sons and their families, especially his spoiled, shallow grandchildren (to Walt's credit I resented them a bit myself; the movie is not interested in making them exactly multifaceted, unless you define multifaceted as managing to be unpleasant, vulgar, and insensitive all at the same time).<br /><br />If Walt was a more articulate person, there is no doubt he would voice his resentment of America's decline in general, embodied by the decline of the once-great Motor City. He spends his days sitting on his porch, sipping an endless succession of Pabst Blue Ribbon cans, and offering a running commentary, to no one in particular, on the sorry state of affairs.<br /><br />Meantime, Thao Vang Lor, the teenager who lives next door, finds himself facing his own troubles, as he is pressured by his gang-leader cousin to abandon his books in favor of automatic weapons, aimless driving, and other trappings of gang life. Peer-pressured into attempting to steal his reclusive next-door neighbor's prized Gran Torino, Thao predictably flubs the robbery and is nearly shot by Walt in the process.<br /><br />The event causes Walt to sit up and take a sharper look at the troubles around him. And little by little - and yet somehow overnight - he becomes a not-especially reluctant protector of the very family whose presence he complained about so lengthily. Sounds familiar? Sure. This is Eastwood territory, and we delight to see him enter it, for no one does it better. Perhaps more than any other actor, Eastwood carries his iconic status with him, in every role he plays. It is unavoidably a part of him - every jaded, raspy word, the grizzled, seen-it-all features, the corded arms and piercing eyes and the slouching confidence he feels for his own two hands and not much else. He could not abandon this if he tried, and we do not want him to.<br /><br />Seeing three teenage bullies harassing the daughter of the family on her way home from school, Walt watches from his truck, growing increasingly incensed. What follows is no less delightful for the predictability of the track it follows. The truck pulls up, a man gets out. The teenagers bluster and advise him to move on. "Every now and then," Walt replies, "you run into a guy you shouldn't have f--ked with. I'm that guy."<br /><br />Yup, we're in Eastwood Country, all right. And it's good to be there.<br /><br />As the film goes on, the violence increases as Walt's heart opens slowly, reluctantly, once again, and he is drawn into the life of his neighbors, who hail him as a savior. There are many nice moments here, and these are made more poignant by the shadow which Walt oh-so-willingly moves under. Eastwood can be wonderfully grouchy when he wishes, and the scenes where the two Hmong children try to draw him out of his shell have a light, pleasant feel to them, even if occasionally a gesture or line ring slightly false.<br /><br />But the good times are not here to stay. This is an Eastwood film, and Eastwood doesn't believe in happy endings. Or, for that matter, peaceful ones. And soon enough an act of loathsome brutality on the part of the gang members spurs Walt into a savage, guilt-ridden consciousness that the semi-playful violence he has so enjoyed flirting with has produced real and insufferable consequences for those closest to him. And with that realization, he heads off to a climax as unavoidable as that in any Western.<br /><br />Eastwood is older, now, and his body, although still strong, is less vital than in some of his past iconic roles. And so we can only hope that there is enough of Harry Callahan or William Munny left in him to succeed. Does he? Yes, and no. And the ending is a strikingly un-Eastwoodesque ending - until one considers for a moment, and decides that maybe it is a quintessential Eastwood ending after all.<br /><br />On the other side of the camera, Eastwood turns in a strong performance (does he know any other kind?) but not a true tour de force. In his defense, the script doesn't allow him this chance - while strong, it does not seem particularly inclined to take him into challenging or uncharted waters. Nonetheless, the machine called Clint Eastwood is going strong, and unlike the Motor City itself, he shows no signs of slowing down.
At first, I really didn't think I'd enjoy this movie. I was so wrong! I laughed, I cried, I was shocked. Great movie, def recommend.
If "Gran Torino" actually proves to be Clint Eastwood's final appearance as an actor (and he has said so), I can't think of a more fitting swansong; his portrayal of an antisocial, racist widower, facing his own mortality while relearning compassion from his hmong neighbors, is a magnificent performance, certainly one of his best. It combines elements of many of his classic characters, with the subtlety and depth 50 years on both sides of the camera has taught him. Some will howl at his language and obvious bigotry, but without this coarseness, we would not truly understand his pain, or fully appreciate his spiritual rebirth.<br /><br />This may sound crazy, but I found myself comparing "Gran Torino" with "The Shootist", John Wayne's final film. Both films involve protagonists who are dying of cancer, mentoring boys, and ultimately ending their lives while ridding society of a dangerous element. With due respect for Wayne, I believe the Eastwood film is far superior; Eastwood's characterization is much deeper, the 'community' is portrayed in a kinder fashion, and the resolution is both smarter, and more effective. The film offers humor, as well, an element largely missing in the Wayne film.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is a film guaranteed to be on the short list of Eastwood's finest; I'm proud to have it in my DVD collection!
This is quite simply one of Clint Eastwood's best acting jobs and the greatest movie of his career.
This was an amazing movie, it made me appreciate different cultures and I found the Clint Eastwood is getting better and better
Gran Torino was Clint Eastwood in all his gloriousness....Have always loved his movies and always will.
I consider myself hard to please when it come to movies. I absolutely loved this movie so much that I had to write a review. Clint Eastwood is very talented. If you get offended by distasteful racial comments then this is a warning because you'll hear it from beginning of movie to the end and he did'nt miss hardly any race or nationality. Highly recommend this movie.
Several things:  this movie is not what I expected. I had some vague idea there was fighting involved, and perhaps some racing around, and figured there would be a big "showdown" ~ after all, it's Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />Also, I once had a huge fight with my ex, who wanted me to see "Saving Private Ryan". His argument: "War is an important topic and you need to see this movie." Mine: "I know it's an important topic, and I don't *need* to see a movie to know it."<br /><br />So, having said that, again, not what I expected. Although I am can be tender-hearted, I rarely cry at movies. I did at this one. And I think people *should* see this movie to learn what happens when the war is over.<br /><br />Clint's character is an old, racist, white man, who, after fighting in Korea, spent his life working for Ford. He has an old Ford truck, and a 1972 Gran Torino, his pride and joy, that incidentally he helped build. His wife has passed on, his kids hate him, he grandchildren only care about what he might leave them, he practically has no friends left, and his neighborhood is now filled with Hmong. Foreigners. Who he hates, wishing they would just leave the neighborhood - or at least keep their yards up.<br /><br />His neighbors hate him, and wish *he* would leave the neighborhood.<br /><br />Stalemate, until the young boy next door tries to steal his Gran Torino as his initiation into a gang, and he catches the boy doing it.<br /><br />I won't go too much into the details, but of course, bad things happen then. Good things as well.  And we learn, in a subtle way, how that war affected him. And his family and children. And his foreign neighbors, and their children. And what "sacrifice" means. I highly, highly recommend this movie. It will touch your heart.
Some people make their living providing much better movie reviews than I can.<br /><br />I'll just say that if you like a good dose of vigilante justice with a redemptive subplot, you'll like this movie.
This is your typical Clint Eastwood character--this time Walt Kowalski--but with a twist. He comes off as the rough, cantankerous, "do not bother me" and "do not bother with me" loner that he is so good at portraying. His neighborhood has changed. He seems heartless in his bigotry and downright mean in his sarcastic and cynical interactions with others, not only his neighbors, but the young local priest. Even any signs of affection, he might show, come off as crude and vulgar. Don't however, let that sway you.<br /><br />It's a great movie. I put it up there with his best.<br /><br />As usual, he helps the underdog, fights against injustice, does the heroic, and becomes the winner--but this time he does it in a different way. All the "crap" he spews is just a smokescreen for the love this character can really issue forth. He winds up doing it in a big way. He lives out the Two Great Commandments: "No greater love ...!" I do not want to spoil the ending in any way. That has to do with the car too!<br /><br />My suggestion: don't let the language and the slurs deter you. They are all part of what makes this real. A real alcoholic oozing with venom for a variety of life issues that feed the disease could not do better. Like I tell people about "Good Will Hunting"--the language may be very offensive, but it's a real part of the movie. Bear with it and you will not regret it.<br /><br />I have loved Clint Eastwood's acting. I now love his directing. This movie provides a special bonus: you get both!
This is one of, if not the best, movie I've seen in a long time.
Clint Eastwood pulls double duty as director and actor here, starring as Walt Kowalski, a mean, cranky old racist who has a change of heart in "Gran Torino".  The journey Walt takes is just one of several making up the movie though.<br /><br />  It starts with the funeral of Walt's beloved wife, who we never see but gather was somewhat of a kinder soul than Walt, and probably a positive influence as far as keeping his nastier character traits at bay.  In the days following the funeral we see Walt as alone and bitter, estranged from the rest of his family and seemingly unable to make emotional connections.  One of the things making him so bitter is that his neighborhood is becoming increasingly Asian in character.  North America is changing, and places that were once almost exclusively white are now more multi-racial or in some case dominated by one particular ethnic group.  This neighborhood has an increasing number of Hmong (a Southeast Asian ethnic group), and it's safe to say that Walt hasn't been overjoyed to see their numbers increasing over the years.  At the start of the movie, he's a racist, not just 'old and set in his ways', not just 'narrow-minded', but outright racist.  The fact that the movie doesn't try to sugarcoat it makes the character's transformation much more powerful.<br /><br />  There are two main interpersonal 'pulls' in the movie - one is Walt's being pulled against his will into the fabric of the neighborhood, the other is a Hmong kid of around 15 (I estimate), Thao (Bee Vang) - Walt's next door neighbor - being pulled against his will into a Hmong-dominated street gang.  He's cousin to one of the heads of the gang, and therefore, as the gang expands further and further from their traditional stomping grounds and into the suburbs, Thao gets invited to join.  In classic gang style, it's an offer he can't refuse.  So little by little he's getting sucked into this lifestyle that he very much wants to avoid, but appears powerless to.  His initiation feat into the gang is to steal his neighbor Walt's classic Gran Torino car.  When he's caught in the act and the other members flee, his family decides his punishment is to 'help out' Walt with yard work, household chores, etc. for the next little while, as atonement.  Walt isn't interested and refuses the deal, but Thao is pushed to try and make ammends anyway.  Not long after, an incident in the neighborhood involving the gang occurs, and Walt becomes the neighborhood hero by running a couple of gang members off.  To Walt's horror, this seems to spur the Hmong community in the neighborhood to 'adopt' him, arriving with gifts and baskets and food, always greeting him warmly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that Walt doesn't like them very much.  Of course, despite his hostility towards Asians, he's never really known one outside of his experiences in the Korean War, where they were on opposite sides (he seems to have plenty of recollections of Koreans as the enemy, but few of the South Koreans as his side's allies).  As he's unwillingly drawn into the community, his feelings toward his Hmong neighbors slowly begin to change...<br /><br />  This may sound cliched or contrived, but absolutely nothing in the movie comes off that way.  Every characterization and interaction - good or bad - feels very genuine.  During this time we see Walt trying and failing to re-establish some kind of connection with his biological family; we also see him being very shocked with himself that he's becoming so close to his 'new' family, particularly Thao and his older sister Sue (Ahney Her), to both of whom he seems to be filling some kind of uncle of even fatherly role.  Meanwhile though, the other pull is still going - the gang's determination to recruit Thao, seemingly motivated primarily by the fact that they're offended by the idea of anyone turning them down.  Thao is increasingly determined not to go that way, but that just seems to make the gang more insistent.  Gran Torino gives a really good picture of the hard spot someone like Thao is in when he's targeted for recruitment like this by a gang that might do anything at all if he doesn't go along with them.  It's a predicament his family sees, and that Walt comes to recognize as well.<br /><br />  The movie becomes extremely intense in its end stages, building up to a tremendously powerful finale.  What's more unexpected is all the humor and, for lack of a better word, 'warmth' that starts coming in about a third of the way through.  These elements don't clash with the tension, but provide a counterpoint.  And as we see in the movie, things can turn from very 'happy' to very, very grim on a dime.<br /><br />  An ability to juggle seemingly disparate tones, and universally excellent performances, help make Gran Torino a great movie on all levels.  For a skillful blend of drama, tenderness and vicious suspense, you can't go better than this one.
Fantastic film and certainly not what I expected. Clint Eastwood dominates the screen like Darth Vader with COPD, growling his way through the movie. Since I don't want to spoil the story line and ending by talking too much, I'll just say that this film is definitely a masterpiece.
Walt Kowalski is a man who seems nearly impossible to get along with.  His kids make attempts (albeit poor ones), his self-involved granddaughter, and even a 27-year-old "virgin" Catholic priest.  It seems that the only person who had any kind of deep connection with him, was his wife.  Any of us who have never been involved in a war, couldn't possibly understand what it does to a person.  It becomes clear that Walt is carrying tremendous guilt about the things he's done in the Korean War.  He can't let it go.  He buries himself in his anger and contempt for nearly everyone else, especially including a Hmong family who has moved in next door.<br /><br />Right from the get-go, it's clear that Walt can't stand them.  They remind him too much of the people he fought against in Korea.  Walt is so used to insulting nearly everyone he meets, that it's practically second nature to him.  It's his defense mechanism, so that he can never have to have a deep connection with anyone.  The only people who can stand him are a couple of drinking buddies at a bar, the town barber, and the town construction supervisor.<br /><br />One night, Thao, the young son of the Hmong family, is pressured by a Hmong gang to attempt to steal Walt's car (the 1972 Gran Torino) as part of a gang initiation.  Walt catches him in the act, which only seems to cement his hatred of them.  When Thao resists doing anything else for the gang, he is threatened by them, and lo and behold, his "savior" happens to be Walt holding an old-style rifle used in the Korea War.  Walt, of course, couldn't care less about Thao, but simply wants them all off his lawn.  Little does Walt realize, that this simple act of protection has opened a door, he never sees.<br /><br />Sue is Thao's older sister.  It's clear that she likes Walt, despite his offensive remarks.  Through Sue, Walt begins to find a connection with the Hmong.  "I have more in common with these people than I do my own family!" he quips.  He's invited to a Hmong gathering, and strange enough to Walt, he's enjoying himself.  Thao is forced to do odd-jobs for Walt to pay off his debt for his attempt to steal Walt's car.  This gives Walt yet another connection...ironically enough to the boy who attempted to steal his car.  Walt sees that Thao isn't like the kids in the Hmong gang, but that this boy actually has a chance to do something with his life.  Walt realizes that this probably won't happen as long as the Hmong gang continues to terrorize Thao and his family.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is arguably one of the best directors in the business.  Some people have complained about the acting of the Hmong cast.  I didn't have a problem with it.  They aren't professional actors, and that is okay.  Instead, it's as if they are simply playing themselves.  Their lines almost seem improvisational and not from a script.  For this film, it works well.  I was especially impressed by young Ahney Her (Sue).  I felt that she wonderfully created the bridge between Sue and Walt.  She's tough, and yet kind and sensitive.  That is a pretty good balance to achieve for a first-time actress.<br /><br />Walt Kowalski is carrying a heavy burden of guilt.  The priest attempts to help Walt, but as Walt explains to him, "You know nothing about life and death, kid."  The priest realizes that Walt is correct.  The priest has never been in a war, nor has ever been asked to take a life because it was his job; and to learn to hate a group of people to help you perform that job.  Like a poison, the anger and guilt is eating Walt up.  Despite what Walt says to the contrary, it's evident that Walt loves Sue and Thao as if they were his own kids.  He helps them, looks after them, and protects them from something he never wants them to ever have to be a part of.<br /><br />Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's last acting job, and boy, does he end his illustrious career with an incredible film.  It's about the power of redemption; about finding a way of excising yourself of the demons that nearly everyone carries; and how holding on to that guilt, eats you up like a cancer.  Some scenes are difficult to watch, and strangely enough, we get used to Walt's constant racial slurs.  I think the reason for this is, that to most of the audience who knows and understands Walt Kowalski, he doesn't really mean it.  He simply doesn't know any other way to communicate.<br /><br />Gran Torino may not seem like a masterpiece, but is really comes close.  For Eastwood's final curtain call, Gran Torino has a lot of power in its message, and many may well view it as a masterpiece.
Clint Eastwood is still a badass, even in old age, and Gran Torino (2008) proves it.  We've all seen him in so many roles that have him playing a tough guy over the years - from his western movies, to Dirty Harry, to Escape From Alcatraz, to this movie, Eastwood always plays a badass tough guy and plays it well.  Clint Eastwood directed, produced and acted in the leading role in this movie.  Eastwood plays the role of Walter Kowalski, a retired factory worker and Korean War veteran who lives near Detroit.  He's old.  He's one of those old, crabby guys that's mad at the world.  He's a racist.  Or at least he starts out this movie as a racist.  His neighborhood has gone from being lilly white to multicultural and overrun by gangs.  His family doesn't have close relations with him.  He's very much alone.<br /><br />His young punk Hmong neighbor, Thao, tries to steal his 1972 Gran Torino out of his garage one night.  Kowalski catches him in the act, but Thao escapes.  The stunt was supposed to be for Thao's initiation into a local gang.  Walt realizes it was his neighbor Thao that tried to steal his car.  Kowalski calms down a bit and has Thao work for him to sort of redeem himself for the crime he almost committed.  The two become friends and from that point various bad things happen to Thao's family that are the result of being victimized by the gangs.  Kowalski's anger toward the gang boils over to the point where he personally wants to see to it that the gang pays for their crimes.  The gang's demise and destruction is Kowalski's ultimate goal.  In the process, his racism evaporates as the movie progresses.  I don't want to reveal the ending.  Watch this movie to see for yourself what happens.<br /><br />I like the character Eastwood plays.  He's rough around the edges, in declining health, hardened by war and his own neighborhood's decline.  He has a filthy mouth.  Only Clint Eastwood can deliver the lines he does in this movie and make them work.  They're so Clint Eastwood-esque.  I find his lines very humorous.  The way he carries himself in this movie is classic.<br /><br />If you want to see a very unique movie that can touch you in some ways, see this movie.  It's not overly complex.  It's very simple but very entertaining.  Highly recommended.
I just finished watching Gran Torino and it's the best movie I've seen in a long while.<br /><br />Maybe I'll come back to write a more in-depth review, but at the moment I just can't.<br /><br />For the average film critic there is probably a handful of false notes that would keep this movie from getting the very best rating. Typically I'm one of those "critics."<br /><br />But this movie touched my heart more deeply than I ever expected.<br /><br />This film gets my very highest recommendation.
This was a really great movie.  It touched my heart in addition to being the type of fast action I expected from Clint Eastwood.  It gave me a lot to think about.  I very rarely find a movie that I would watch a second time, but I could watch this one again.
This movie is by far one of the greatest, and most touching films I've ever had the privilege to see. The storyline and character developement was perfect, the Hmong cast did very well despite their lack of prior experience, and the bitter-sweet ending so amazing that it actually brought a tear to my eyes. Anyone who gives this film a negative review is usually full of themselves, too PC, or just doesn't understand the film alltogether. And again, a lot of you need to consider that most (if not all) of the Hmong cast had NO prior acting experience. So think about that before making such harsh judgements about them.
Clint Eastwood goes to the extreme in this movie. Talks about a real world issue that is touching and it hits home for many.<br />The neighborhood reminds me of my Grandpa's place in Alabama and the story is just written so well.<br />He went above and beyond to find new actors and actresses (you find out how in the special features) and even though they are new, I believe they did an outstanding job. Some may be offended by the racial remarks in the movie, so be advised on that.<br />Overall, just a plain COOL MOVIE!!!
Clint Eastwood is a master! His direction of Gran Torino and Walt Kowalski, his character in the film, is just one more example. And Bee Vang's portrayal of Thao is wonderful.
Crusty, "set in his ways" Korean War vet Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) confronts a threat of gang violence in his community and his own prejudice when he tries to help his next door neighbors who are Asian.  Everything has already been said about this film--- just watch it.  Great movie about family, life, loss, and relationships and opening your heart to others.  Another Eastwood hit!!!!<br /><br />***HIGHLY RECOMMENDED***
...And not many can pull that off. I pride myself in having seen every Clint Eastwood movie. Some were good, some were so-so, some were outstanding. Before watching "Gran Torino" I had no idea what to expect. All I knew was it was about an aging Korean vet living in a neighborhood with Asians. A clash of cultures, prejudice and especially war memories. Eastwood's character doesn't respect Asians; in fact he hates every aspect of them as well as their culture. But he learns as he gets to know them. The friendship between Walt and the Asian boy develops as the movie progresses. I am not going to spoil the end of this gem of a movie but I want to say that the ending could make you feel sad, but it doesn't. Very weird but that's the magic of movie making and Eastwood proves yet again he's a pro before as well as behind the camera.<br /><br />I can't recall having enjoyed a simple movie like this over the past couple of years. It's a delight to watch. Yes, Clint is older, but he's not ready for a retirement home, meaning he can still kick butt (and does so)! In fact his character could be described as an old and cranky Dirty Harry but with moral standards and a touch of humanity.<br /><br />Even if you're not an Eastwood fan, this is truly a great movie from start to finish. I would even go this far in saying that it surely ranks as one of the zeniths of his career. Thank you Clint. You were and are a giant!
