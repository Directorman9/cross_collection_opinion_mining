It maybe a nice phone but got a lot of camera problems like the common pink camera. I don't care about that soo much. It lags sooo much and it's battery jumps. The battery switches off in 60% to 80%. That's basically using 40% to 20% only. Moreover, the battery is really bad. Would have been an amazing phone if these problems weren't there.; It maybe a nice phone but got a lot of camera problems like the common pink camera. I don't care about that soo much.

It's my favorite phone design ever which is why I bought another one second-hand. But being released in March 2013 and being the oldest, it has got to be the slowest phone I own. The same problems like purple photos, overheating, and short battery life when I first owned one is still present. Going on Sense 6 and KitKat just makes it even worse with lag and stuttering animations all over the place like if I holding a G1 with Donut.

Been using Android since 2011. My first Android was the Nexus One. But it is this 2013 One that helped me fall in love with Android. That's why I bought it a second time around. Just love the design. 
 
 Would NOT really use it much though. Too laggy and battery life is pretty awful. Just a memento phone. It still looks great next to my silver S7 edge and doesn't show smudges and dirt like the S7e does on the back.

 Missing my Pixel and G5 right now. Pixel is just fluid UI. G5 is better to type on because slightly bigger display where you won't accidentally touch the home button below the keyboard space bar as often like on the Pixel. 
 
 Will use the Pixel/G5 tomorrow as they are a better duo with the best fluid experience. The prettiest duo of the glacial silver M7 and platinum S7e stutters too much.

Thinking on changing it know but it works perfectly.
I actually got a second model of this phone last night for $60 used. It is in very good condition with maybe some tiny nicks on the bezels from the plastic case it came with. I sold my M7 two years ago and just missed the design and audio.
 
 Honestly, this M7 is just a memento. It is my 9th phone currently and my 3rd phone I got within 4 days. I didn't remember it being kinda laggy. TV remote app won't work. HTC browser app crashes.The touch response was smooth when I got it in 2013 but doesn't feel as smooth as my current daily drivers from 2016. Still has the purple photos. Still charges very slow with more time charging and less SOT.
 
 So stuff I hated about it is still there. But I missed it for its design and audio. I remember back in 2013, it took me a long time to adjust to its size. Maybe a year since coming from iPhone 4 and Nexus One. I hold it last night and it feels so easy to hold. I prefer the M7's size and design but would rather have the performance of the M8.
 
 M7 still a great phone by HTC achieving many accolades for them. Overrated by reviewers like the S7 edge was last year but probably HTC's best design ever. I do prefer its design over the M8, M9, Xperia Z3, and Galaxy S6/S7 edges. Close to smartphone design perfection for me using metal. This second one is on 4.4.3 with TMo with no carrier logo on the rear while my first one was stuck on 4.1.2 and AT&T. 
 
 But would I use it as a daily driver now? Oh, hell no! Goes back using the often maligned and UGLY G5 and Pixel for smooth performance, longer battery life, fast charging, great cameras, and rarely gets warm. I would only use this M7 as a third wheel since my Sprint G5 which is unlocked for both international and domestic can't get data with TMo like my TMo S7e and Verizon Pixel.

In my honest opinion, this was the most ground breaking phone ever made and I feel so sorry that it can not keep up anymore in every day use because I loved it while I owned it. Apart from the buggy camera on some models, everything else this phone had to offer was absolutely amazing.
 However, this phone is still good enough for people that use it as a regular phone and some browsing.

I've had the One M7 for 3 years and I still like it. Reliable, good quality, and reasonable battery life. Only con is it can only run up to Android 5.1 but that's not a problem for most people.

I have bought this phone 3 years ago and so far it has endured all sorts of torture. I have lost its own adapter years ago and charge it with any adapter I can find; and still the battery is in top shape! Furthermore, it has twice dropped screen-down (once from a 1.5 meter height on concrete and once from a 3 meter height in marble slab) and apart from very minor dents in its body - no damage was done whatsoever. I backup/restore and reset to factory settings every 8 months or so - making my stock Lollipop running perfectly. The only downside is the main camera and its pink tint.
 I can honestly say that in overall this phone is an endurance flagship to rival NOKIA.; I have bought this phone 3 years ago and so far it has endured all sorts of torture.

I thought I should make you all aware that HTC are running a scam that will cost you more than the value of your phone, if you send it in for warranty repair.
 
 HTC outsource their customer support services abroad and they are absolutely horrendously incompetent and frustrating to deal with.
 
 I had a recurring fault where my phone stopped charging. 
 
 I sent my phone to them via UPS who delivered within 3 days. HTC lost my phone for 2 weeks. When they found it (not sure it's my phone that they found) there were two new faults with the phone. They say my camera and microphone were faulty. The original fault was covered by warranty, but the two new problems weren't and they quoted that I pay almost £90. If I don't, they will send back my phone but I would have to pay £26.37 to get it back un-repaired.
 
 I have called and spoken to them 9 times so far regarding this. For the first 4 times they just told me that my phone had been received and that their system would be updated within 2 days. After 4 calls, I asked for a manager to call me back, which they promised each time within 4 hours and then within an hour. On the 9th call I eventually was transferred to their escalations team where Bruce just talked over me, patronised me, "wasn't sure if I heard what he said", and just kept repeating the same thing over and over.
 
 According to Bruce, the original fault (not charging) is covered by warranty, but the camera and microphone that weren't broken when I sent the phone to them, aren't covered and HTC do not do partial repairs. In direct contravention of consumer protection laws, HTC will not send me back my phone unless I pay them £26.37 or authorise them to carry out the unnecessary repairs and pay them almost £90. I consulted a solicitor who confirmed that HTC are in breach of consumer protection law but HTC will not budge.

 Next I will try LG G5 to see if it can replace this baby but the design of that sucks

 There is something next to you can not ignore, a camera that almost every model is broken and does pink pictures, this is a joke from the HTC site.

 a quick phone,
 comfortable in the hand
 cons

It was very bad experience with htc. They have very poor hardware even htc itself does not have trust on their hardware. Let me know you my htc experience.
 
 I had bought htc desire x. htc gives one year warranty but their phone gives an problem with their wifi and hotspot. I had given to the service center and they replaced the mother board and gave 3 months extended warrenty and after 3.5 months later the camera stopped working and again they asked to replace the mother board with the price of Rs.6500/- and current value of htc desire x in market was only Rs.4000/- and again they can give just 3 months warranty of mother board. So finaly they have 3rd class hardware worst than chinese mobile phones. Shame on you guys (HTC).

The camera purple tint is a well known issue for more than 2 years by now... it's a hardware issue (so don't hope that software update can solve it!)... the only solution is - send back to the nearest HTC service centre! If your device is still under warranty, HTC will replace the camera part for free, otherwise you need to pay for it...; The camera purple tint is a well known issue for more than 2 years by now... it's a hardware issue (so don't hope that software update can solve it!)... the only solution is - send back to the nearest HTC service centre!

My M7 is approaching 2yrs old. Love it. Stil looks beautiful. I thought lack of SD card would be as problem but my concerns are unfounded. Battery is only now starting to show its age. Cameras focus would be my gripe. I genuinely cannot justify upgrading, although I'm trying to do so. For my next phone it will definitely be The One but please let them stare at my SILVER, not gold, phone. &#128512;; My M7 is approaching 2yrs old. Love it. Stil looks beautiful.

The HTC one (M8) phone from my experience, is probably the worst phone that I have ever seen. After going through three replacements in a matter of a few months, I gave up and switched to a different phone. The problems I encountered were extremely frustrating as neither of my HTC ones functioned properly for more then a couple of weeks. Two weeks after getting my first HTC one, which before that I was quite pleased by it although it was sometimes a bit complicated, the network started suddenly dropping even though I was in places that everyone else was getting network. Even if I had network, I would receive text messages days later all at once making communication almost impossible. I checked with my network provider and nothing was wrong with the networking, the problems were from the phone... I then bought a new one for someone in my family thinking that the one I had was just from a bad series, I was wrong. More problems this time involving, the phone not responding at sometimes and having to restart it to factory mode, the network doing the same stunt as my phone, the front camera inexplicably started having a purple tint which got so bad it was unusable. Then, not being able to switch to another phone with my contract at that moment, I had my old one replaced by, unfortunately, a new HTC one... After not even a week of having a brand new phone, it started shutting off and turning back on every five minutes and no matter what I did (factory reset, launching in safe mode, installing older android versions...) it would eventually keep on shutting down and starting up again... I threw that phone away immediately not wanting to deal with having to get another replacement. From my experiences, I repeat, HCT ones are the WORST phones anyone could possibly ever imagine of getting and I do not seem to be alone with having all these issues as I could estimate after spending an incredible amount of time on the internet that at least 50 % of users have at least one major problem with this phone. My advice to you, avoid at any cost of getting an HTC one. If people say that I just had a faulty series, the fact that having three different phones purchased at three different times and having problems in every one of them proved that wrong. HTC one phones are a nightmare and you should never consider of buying one.; The HTC one (M8) phone from my experience, is probably the worst phone that I have ever seen.

HTC one M7 is such a useless and overpriced phone, have been using it for less than 2 years now. I thought there was something wrong with my camera as it could not focus on images beyond 3 feet and images turn purple or red in low light conditions. If you want to check your camera, turn it on and cover the lens in low light conditions,the display should show black colour, if its purple or red instead, then your camera has a manufacturing defect. So I had it sent to the service center and they returned the phone in 2 weeks saying the phone is perfectly fine(SURPRISE). I thought it was only mine but I go-ogled it and found there are thousands of other cases. I had a china phone worth 100 bucks with a better camera. Such a shame.

I have this phone for 1 and half year. Bought a completely new from eBay. Almost from the beginning noticed 3 big problems: 1) screen jumps/bands/troubles when overheating - HTC refused to repair as I didn't buy from an official seller. 2) every impact - scratch remains seen as it's body is Aluminium with a thin black coating, 3) camera quality is too low for such device - probably related to unsuccessful ultrapixel technology.

 Honestly speaking ,HTC one camera is far inferior from any midrange mobile I guess.
 washed out colour,very bad contrast.
 only passable low light photography.
 screen is nowhere with Amoled screen,
 poorest sunlight legibility,,Batter charging takes 3hrs at least...

Good phone, had it's share of trouble, but still good. Lollipop runs like a charm, camera is not as bad as all these low-knowledge users around here will tell you (HDR feature particularly helpful). Use it as a satnav daily and work perfectly, very good gps reception. Screen is unexpectedly good and sound is ok for what it is. All in all, very pleased.; Good phone, had it's share of trouble, but still good.

Had many HTC's from Mozart, 3D etc this M7 was the best yet.

I had given to the service center and they replaced the mother board and gave 3 months extended warrenty and after 3.5 months later the camera stopped working and again they asked to replace the mother board with the price of Rs.6500/- and current value of htc desire x in market was only Rs.4000/- and again they can gove just 3 months warranty of mother board.

Hi, I had previously used HTC one v, which almost used more than 3.5 years. Very Satisfied. Now too, its working. But just a single problem ( i.e ) The call function doesn't work. No other problems I had. Now I'm going to buy HTC one 32 GB, LTE . Can anyone please say me, if there is an update of 4.4 for HTC one? I don't need lollipop udpate meaning it would be good, if I have lollipop update. But I would be well satisfied if I receive the KitKat ( 4.4.4 ) update. Because it should support games. That's why I'm asking. On the specifications from the online website that I'm going to buy has put like this :
 
 Android version : 4.1.2.
 
 So please say me whether I can update my phone to 4.4.4. If known, then I can buy phone with no hesitation. 
 
 Thanks.

Overall a terrible experience with HTC one.
 
 After using the phone for 2 years, I have to say that I'm never buying another HTC product.
 
 Here are the issues I've faced. 
 
 After 2 short months, (no drops or other sort of abuse) the camera that started to have a purplish tinge around the corners(a friend who had the same model complained of the same problem). Around the same time, the battery started to have an issue. It would turn hot and deplete within an hour of usage which was mainly web browsing. This was fixed after sending it for repair.
 
 After 6 months from the repair date, the battery issue resurfaced and deteriorated, battery life plummeted. Today, it can never charge more than 10%, and takes 2 hours to charge 5% to only drop back down to zero with minutes of usage.
 
 Conclusion: Never buy a HTC product unless you have a thing for bad hardware and workmanship.; Overall a terrible experience with HTC one.; After using the phone for 2 years, I have to say that I'm never buying another HTC product.; Here are the issues I've faced.; After 2 short months, (no drops or other sort of abuse) the camera that started to have a purplish tinge around the corners(a friend who had the same model complained of the same problem).

This was the nicest smart phone I've ever had (I've owned Samsung Stellar/Samsung Galaxy S-III/HTC One/Droid Mini). I only paid a penny for it on amazon which could have had some effect on my opinion I admit. The audio isn't nearly as great as they like to advertise but it is quite better than any other phone. It runs really well, I never had a problem with any lag, every app opened and ran seamlessly. The screen looks great. Despite there only being a 4MP camera, the pictures don't look bad at all. The size is good as well, not giant like most nice phones currently. The battery was very decent. It's a really great phone and if I didn't drop it in my toilet I'd still be using it today. That's one issue, the back does not come off which makes it far less likely to be able to get your phone repaired if you end up needing that. I'd give it an 8.5/10.; This was the nicest smart phone I've ever had (I've owned Samsung Stellar/Samsung Galaxy S-III/HTC One/Droid Mini).

Ok, not so much new except some make up here and there and the Sense 6.0 is not changed and if you ask why than Sense was way before Lollipop than the actual one. One thing is missing and that is the Guest Mode som much talked about and I hope HTC will do something in this regard.

I had this phone for close to 2 years, and the first 9 or 10 months were amazing, I thought I had the best phone on the market. After a year, shit went downhill. The camera started to have a purple tint in it and the quality was degraded, the touch buttons were sometimes unresponsive and even though it had an aluminum unibody, the bar of the front camera and top speaker began to come off (My bad for not putting it on a case).; I had this phone for close to 2 years, and the first 9 or 10 months were amazing, I thought I had the best phone on the market.

lets start with the bad news first. a few months ago, my htc one konked out. it just showed a green screen, can't reboot, can't do a damn thing. all my memory - photos, settings, etc, all lost. 
 
 Fortunately, the story gets a lot better from here. I brought it into the HTC customer service shop here in Singapore. It was just beyond the warranty but they agreed to fix it for free. A few days later, when I went back to get the phone, they returned it, fully functioning. They also replaced the camera and vibrator, saying they found them faulty. 
 
 Since then, the phone has been working perfectly. The new camera is much better - sharper and a lot better in dim lighting. Recently, I also upgraded the software to 6.13.707.7. I thought it was lollipop but actually still 4.4.3. But once over that mild disappointment, the phone turned out to be a lot smoother under this software upgrade. Everything - the touch, the swipe, even the typing - all buttery smooth, comparable with Apple!

I would like to explain my big inconvenience with Htc warranty service, that i have bought HTC Desire X Dual Sim (11395-00 rupees ) on 08-06-2014 at Girias Investment (P)Ltd.
 When i bought it after four days it has got a slight crack in display after falls down. but performance is quietly brilliant until 17-12-2014 , by the day i have used last i just unplug while charging ,from then on my phone is completely shutting down & not displays anything. then i have given to HOSUR service center, after 7 days HTC service center executive called me and told the estimated cost of rupees 11600-00 to repair.
 because i am sending this mail to you I am a warranty customer why should i have to pay for repair over than mobile's purchase cost & one more thing i need to share with you i was using same mobile before i bought it, unfortunately somewhere that mobile got misplaced. i had a great experience with HTC mobile but now iam completely got hurt ,i hope you get the proper response to this entire conversation.

JUNK. I have had this marvel of 10th century engineering for a year now. I have yet to find it useable. The volume buttons are on the wrong side. The keyboard is too small. The ".com" button is too close to the space bar. The "home" button is too close to the screen so every time you use an app/game in landscape, you end up pushing the "home" button. The "unlock" button is too difficult to operate one handed. The HTC Sense news thing was annoying (I shut it off). I cannot find where most of my downloaded pictures went. There are too many native apps that I can't get rid of (Beats? Really? Am I 14?). And even though you shut the app off, you can't uninstall the darn thing. The build in MP3 player is garbage and the updates have made it worse. The messenger keeps crashing since the last update. The phone interface is difficult and requires too many buttons to be pressed. I can't cut and paste a number from a website and call it, you have to type it in then press "call". The app store is pushy. The updates are never ending and you can't "not" update lest it remind you again in 2 hours.
 I could go on, but why.

The phone is good but it came with a factory problem of having purple camera tint, and a dead pixel on the screen. That does not scream quality to me aside from the phone's aluminum sleek finish thats all.
 So before warranty expired, I sent HTC the phone, they fixed the camera and sent me the phone back. All good.
 After 4 months of use, all of a sudden the top speaker started having a crackling/popping noise. All I could do is send it back to HTC, and pay a big amount to just fix that damn speaker. 
 This makes me just imagine that this problem is common in the M8 due to the dual speakers grill. 
 HTC has good looking phones, and an excellent UI, but they are as equally as delicate as they are well built. So, basically you will have to take care of the phone as if it was a piece of jewelry. I am not buying HTC again, unless and until they give extended warranty plans. The phones are good, but are not as reliable and dependable for rough as Iphones and samsung. Those phones really last.; The phone is good but it came with a factory problem of having purple camera tint, and a dead pixel on the screen.

Exellent Phone for daily use with a stunning look n feel!!
 Following r ma impressions abt this phone with my last couple month experience..
 1. Exellent Screen Quality. They way it showing each images, txts in the phone s exellent. Than any other newest phones.
 2. Exellent Audio Qulity. The headphone comming with th package itself is too good enough for a music lover.
 3. Stunning proccessing n builtin 32GB internal memory n 2GB Ram. I never need to think abt an aditional memmory card. Till now this phone never hanged n i didnt do a single restart. (Im using this phone only from last 3months)
 4. Its a flagship phone from HTC. Only becouse f that HTC keep update u wirh their software updations. Coz im experiencing other midrange HTC n Samsung phones.
 
 And rest of all features are extremly satisfying for me. 
 
 If u want most power full phone with a budgetary price tag, if it is available in ur local market go n grab it. This phone gives u watever u want from a smartphone. (Infact morethan from an iphone 6 or Samsung shit :) )
 
 FYI, My previous phones : Nokia 3310, Nokia 1100, Sony Ericsson W700,Nokia 6300,Samsung Ace,Samsung S3, Iphone 5.

I had high hopes for this phone. The camera has the purple tint issue and takes blurry images. The UI, regardless of which ROM is installed, is not very fluid. The battery life is actually good though compared to my Nexus 4. 
 
 Aesthetically, it is a good looking phone. But when it comes to usability it needs some work. The bezel is way too large and I understand that the speakers needs some room but, come on, the black bezel around the screen is unnecessarily wide.; I had high hopes for this phone.

Anonymous, 06 Nov 2014Guys can any 1 suggst whch phone should I buy LG G2 or HTC One M7 I have had my HTC One for about a week now. Previous phones have been iPhone 5/5S, Samsung GS4, and Note 3. For me, the HTC is the best of all worlds. Screen is beautiful, Android 4.4.2 has been solid, navigating is snappy, and camera takes pictures that are good enough for sharing. I would recommend checking out other phones to get a feel for size/weight of phone, but I am very happy with my choice. If you decide to get it the One check BB. I was able to get the HTC One for under $300.; I have had my HTC One for about a week now. Previous phones have been iPhone 5/5S, Samsung GS4, and Note 3. For me, the HTC is the best of all worlds.

good looking piece of garbage! Had this for 6 months and the crap stopped working overnight without a reason; I haven't root it or installed any third party software that could cause the damage. HTC doesn't backup their garbage so now I ended up with a pretty darn expensive paper weight. When some say that Chinese companies are garbage they are right, they should honestly be forbidden to sell substandard stuff on the US market. To all those that like this wannabe phone research it and see how many weird issues are associated with it, then consider yourselves lucky if it's going to last you until you get rid of it.; good looking piece of garbage!

Bought HTC one M7 last year, i bought it was because i really like the previous HTC phone. But turn out it was a nightmare for me.
 
 The phone that i have got two major problems
 1) Will shut down by itself and it will not charge
 2) Camera lens - pink colors
 
 Over the 1 year warranty period, the problems have occurred several times and i have to send my phone to service center at KL-Malaysia, and usually i have to wait 2 weeks to 1 months to get back my phone. 
 
 Several weeks or few months later, same problems occurred. I even complaint to the stuff at the service centre, i said since the problems is always the same, it means HTC company just changing the same parts without really rectify the problems. 
 
 Felt very sad of HTC, although i like the design and features of this phone, but a phone which always shut down, camera lenses always turn pink, i better opt for other choices.

This problem is killing me. I love this phone but i hate this phone at the same time. I restart the phone and the audio goes off. Why do i restart the phone? My earbuds were not working. When i plugged it in it didnt show me the icon that appears when you plug the earbuds in. And this has been happening since i had Sense 5.5. It resolves itself after like a hundred restarts, or a hard reset or connecting to a computer and transfer data but you never know how is it actually going to be fixed. I dont know i think its a software problem it occurs every week, sometimes after 2 weeks and it could take a month as well. This is the most annoying problem the audio goes off for just the media, i can hear and speak on the call which pisses me off that why is it only with the media like songs and videos then. There is no problems at all on the calls. And i updated htc one m7 from sense 5.5 to sense 6 and my phone started acting up. It actually started acting up while it was still on the sense 5 it stopped charging. yes, you read that correct the phone stopped charging and i'm losing battery by the second..somehow the audio was back but it wasnt charging. I updated it to sense 6 and it didnt solve my problem. I turned it off and kept it off for maybe 1 whole day (the battery had drained to 0%) and the next day i put it on charge and suddenly it started charging. And the audio was there, no problems at all for 2 months and now its here again!

I had used phones starting from Nokia, LG, Blackberry & finally landed into HTC One. One statement, its an awesome phone & worth the money I had spent on it. Purchased the same day it got launched in Mumbai, India in May 2013, since then never came across any issues, neither on software nor on hardware. Even after more then 1 year of usage, it is as good as new. HTC hats off to you guys.; I had used phones starting from Nokia, LG, Blackberry & finally landed into HTC One.

As a year long HTC one owner I can tell you that the phone is nothing short of fantastic! People complain about heating issue, lag and battery life. Personally my One only started heating up during extensive use or intense games. As for lag, only from time to time. You have to expect this from ANY android device that has a custom skin overlaying it. Samsung may have good phones overall but their touchwiz overlay is the worst of all. Plus they force you with features you don't need. Which slows down your phone to begin with and not meet up with its specs potential. Anyway let's look at the facts:
 
 1.The difference is the One's aluminum body. Aluminum is a very good heat conductor, so when the CPU gets hot, the phone's body acts as a heat sink, pulling the heat away from the CPU. This is good for the CPU. Also due to the heat distribution the body will be equally warm. HTC has updated its sense ui to kitkat, which is arguably much less power consumption thus less heat ect ect. 
 
 2.HTC knew that the battery life could have been an issue so through software they integrated a power saver mode which gets me through the day on regular use. 
 
 Now if your worried about the heating issue when u play games or use it too long the get a $7 case from eBay. That simple.; As a year long HTC one owner I can tell you that the phone is nothing short of fantastic! People complain about heating issue, lag and battery life.

By far one of the best cell phones on the market today. I have a Samsung phone as well which comparibly is near equal to the HTC. All in all I would rate 9 out of 10 for this phone the 1 point loss on the camera. Mind you I take my Samsung over this for pictures anyway, and will rarely usd this phone for pics.Credit to HTC on supplying the consumer with a overall quality product.Thanks to those all who are involved in development of such excellent products.Keep up the amazing work and look forward to upcoming future products. Cant wait to see whats in store for us. Thanks.

The best camera phone for night shooting, but don't buy this HTC One if you want to shoot a picture at night. I recommend the Nokia price around $25-$30 is better then HTC One for night shooting.

HTC One is definitely a nice lovely cell phone which has hit the market very much in Pakistan but the camera which has been provided is not up to mark. The problem with the camera that it cannot produce the photographs in the night because the camera does not have the correct vision in the night. I contacted the shop which I brought the cell phone but they told me that the cell has some problem with the camera and the person from Taiwan is coming across to Karachi to fix up the cell problem. I don't know how far this is true but would really appreciate if something can be done to fix the camera night vision. My e-mail address is badshah_51@hotmail.com. Once again I would really appreciate if the problem can be solved and my cell no is 923008252591.

This has been the worse phone I have ever owned. I have had problems from the beginning. Every time there is an update at least one or two apps get messed up. The camera was one of the selling points for me and that has been the biggest disappointment. Hard to point and shoot. Zoe has burned something in my mother board and my pictures now have a purple tint. Even before this the pictures were very grainy. I am so disappointed. I haven't even had this phone for 11 months. I can switch to a new phone from something else on the account coming up for renewal in a few weeks and that is exactly what I'm going to do. Of course, this will cost me another $200. I'm done with HTC.; This has been the worse phone I have ever owned. I have had problems from the beginning. Every time there is an update at least one or two apps get messed up.

Josphat, 04 Sep 2014I have HTC one and whenever I try to connect it on a my PC I can't see it please help.You just have to:
 1. uninstall the HTC Sync Manager,
 2. disable your antivirus and firewall,
 3. download a new version of HTC Sync Manager (with AV and firewall disabled!)
 4. install the new HTC Sync Manager (with AV and firewall disabled!)
 5. After installation, connect your phone and wait for the drivers to install. (Again with AV and firewall disabled.)
 
 After that, every time you connect won't be a problem. Read somewhere that AV and windows firewall doesn't allow some files to be downloaded or installed for the sync manager to work properly.
 
 Anyway, hope this helps!

the One M7 has everything I need from a high-end
 smartphone. its aluminum unibody construction oozes premium quality.
 Sure, HTC's 2014 flagship, the HTC One (M8) , is a better phone
 with a bigger screen and a few new tricks up its sleeve. The LG
 G3 has an insane pixel count, the iPhone 5s lets you unlock it
 with your fingerprint and the Galaxy S5 can soak in a glass of
 water without going kaput. Those are all fun features and, if all
 else were equal ... sure, I'd take most of them.
 but OEMs just trying harder and harder to look
 like their latest devices make the older ones obsolete.
 and for the purlpe tint issue,the damage to the camera sensor caused by heat,and its permanent.

We own 2 HTC cell phones. Very unhappy . Camera does not worked, nothing but problems since we bought the expensive phones. Was told by Sprint that they are having nothing but problems with the camera in the HTC. We called HTC, spoke to DARIO customer Service Manager who told us we would have to pay to have our phone fixed. Why? Have already paid over $1000.00. We are going back to our I Phone. Will never buy a HTC phone again.; We own 2 HTC cell phones. Very unhappy . Camera does not worked, nothing but problems since we bought the expensive phones.

Edit: Absolutely no problem with the One. It was because of my old PC's USB problems. As for pink tint issues and mic problems that some are whining about, well it's just your bad luck. If yours was a crappy one, it doesn't mean the whole brand is crap. Use your warranty if you can still make use of it, simple. Be practical and grow up.; Edit: Absolutely no problem with the One.

Guys do you suggest the HTC One (M7)?
 If I get this phone I will keep it for around 2 years(or less). Do you think HTC One E8 is better ? (better specs )
 Or you suggest me to wait a month or so to get the HTC One (M8)??? I dont care about the camera...

I will never in my life purchase another HTC phone. I have had my phone for about 6 months or so and I have had to send it back to the manufacture twice. My phone would get extremly hot and stop working. This is when its not even charging. When I plug it up to charge it gets even worse. I damn near got burnt from it.

My Husband has HTC One M7 on Android 4.4.2 in UK Vodafone locked to network.
 
 He is having phone calls dropped when phoning me on my Google Nexus 5 LG which is not Network Locked or Branded.
 
 When I phone my friend on Virgin Mobile on his Motorola Moto X I get no cut off of calls.
 
 I have this evening tried ringing Vodafone and HTC.
 
 Vodafone are useless like a chocolate fire guard.
 
 I rang HTC who advised that Android 4.4.4 will not be coming as they are doing a temporary patch on 4.4.3 as they will be issuing Android L for HTC One M7.
 
 The guy also advised that 4.4.3 has been temporarily withdrawn due to faults in it and will be re issued soon. How soon he was not sure for locked handsets but did not wish to give a timescale that turned out be wrong.
 
 Please can anyone advise me if they have locked Vodafone HTC One M7 and if they are having call drop issues.
 
 My Husband is in mind to sell his HTC One and buy a Google Nexus 5 as mine is working without problem.

A BIG NO TO HTC ONE. A CRAP METAL from HTC, a COMPANY THAT CHEATS customers in the name of selling a flagship phone !!
 
 As a happy owner of HTC desire HD, was very happy with the announcement of “HTC one” last year and that excitement pushed me to sign a 2 years contract with Singtel and own the same for myself after paying a hefty $350+ upfront payment, since the device was not available with other vendors then.
 I was a proud owner of a stunning device with all the newest features that a smart phone could have then. Unfortunately that pride did not last long, had to visit the HTC service center as per SingTel’s recommendation after they tried to fix my 3G/4G connection issue with a SIM card replacement. HTC service center happily repaired the device and handed it over to me and I accepted it without knowing that it was just a beginning of what turned out to be my painful experience with the device and its vendor’s service. Yes after less than two months had to visit the service center again, again they repaired and told that the device was working properly, then again I had to visit them in few days, this time they said they replaced the motherboard and I thought it would be the end of my mental agony and wasting of my valuable time with the service centers, but NO …NO .. Here again, I have a big issues like “Cannot speak / listen to when a call is made, the calls getting disconnected often, a strange sound from device speakers, not able to attend a call using head phones…
 
 This time I did not want to go the service center again and instead wanted to escalate this to Singtel who, actually the seller of the device to me. Met a Customer Service executive at “SingTel Customer service center, West Mall complex, Bukit Batok” on 16th July, 2014 with all those previous report cards of the HTC service center and explained him about the current issue with my device and he did confirm the issues from his end and promised me that this would be escalated to the management and later introduced the stores Retail Operations manager Mr. Low Kiang Fook, who said the reports card have been scanned and send across to HTC and till they respond I ought to be using some other phone or go for a contract renewal to buy a new phone. 
 
 Now after posting this horrible experience in HTC singapore's facebook site, got a call from them requesting to send the mobile for servicing again. I thought there would be a permenant solution for every thing this time , but NO NO NO !!! ...they diagnosed the device again and quoted $300 for upperboard + main board replacement +diagnosis charge since this device is now 15 months old !!!and the last mother board that was changed last march only has 3 months warrenty .. MY GOSH !! This time I wanted to respond them the following way 
 
 How could you ( HTC ) brazenly ask money for the repair when you have sold a DEFECTIVE device to a customer. 
 
 This CRAP DEVICE went for servicing for four times in less than 15 and a half months since I bought this in the month of April, 2013 and this is the third time you are suggesting a motherboard replacement (motherboard was changed twice during first 11 months of the purchase and the recent one being in the month of March, 2014 ). Are four servicing and 3 Mother board replacements in 15 months acceptable for a so-called PREMIUM, FLAGSHIP phone from HTC ??.
 I am adding all the previous communications, report cards for your reference and if you have some dignity, morality and business ethics left in you ( HTC ), accept that you have cheated a customer by selling a defective device and compensate my losses (Money/service/time/mental peace ) with a 1 to 1 replacement. If you still want me to pay the money for your FAULT, then let me convey this . !!! KEEP THE PIECE OF CRAP WITH YOU, CONSIDER THE DEVICE as my donation for your R&D dept to try producing a REAL FLAGSHIP device !!. I WILL MAKE SURE THAT MY HORRIBLE & PATHETIC EXPERIENCE WITH HTC ONE GETS to EVERY POSSIBLE SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE & BLOG AND STOPS PEOPLE FROM FALLING PREY TO THIS HOAX of BUYING A FLAGSHIP PHONE FROM HTC; A BIG NO TO HTC ONE.

You just can't Beat its sound output both in earphones or Loudspeaker when compared with Sony or Samsung phones! Hi guys! I've been using Xperia S since 2 years. Its been a week completed with my HTC one M7. The most beautiful looking phone in my office, said by my colleagues.
 It came with Sense 6.0 and 4.4.2 out of the box.
 Camera :- I think its focuses is like SLR cameras. The blur effect is just amazing. Lot of difference than my misty, dull 12 MP Xperia S photos. Luckily I did not find pink tint issue.
 Processor:- Spc says 2GBRAM, actual in phone 1.7GB RAM. 55 to 60% always in use but still no lag at all.
 Beats audio is good but to really get the BASS out of it, you should install Poweramp after that Boom..Boom you hear even if you put big Headphones unlike the under powered amps in Sony Phones.
 Battery:- Slow charging time :(..Standby time is good but start using whatsapp and you'll loose battery 1% in every 10 minutes.
 Heat:- Don't use Chrome, it heats the phone like lava. I know, the metal body helps. Stock browser is far better.
 What you will like about this phone :-
 Sound output like PC. 70% I use for music, that's why I choose HTC phone.
 Camera like SLR.
 Fast Processing speed.
 
 You won't like:-

 The only cons is the camera (even though it's not that bad, and video recording is top quality) and maybe the battery. For being just 2300mAh it lasts more than I expected, but I think it would have not been so difficult to use a bigger battery to assure we can always reach 24 hours of normal use; NeEarly Perfect phone.; 10/7/10; The only cons is the camera (even though it's not that bad, and video recording is top quality) and maybe the battery.

 The Pros make it worthwhile. Battery life is ideal, I text often, 2-4000 a month, and I usually have about 20% battery at the end of the day (7am-midnight). That 4MP camera is very good in lower light, better than iPhone 5s and in my opinion, better than GS4. The aluminum case is tough, I've dropped it on asphalt with cosmetic damage to the corners, but no cracked screen (unlike my friend's GS4 that cracked from a 3ft drop onto hardwood flooring). It has a great WIFI antenna, and can be used as a universal remote for regular television sets (it has an IR emitter, I turn off TVs at walmart every time I go using my phone).; I've had mine since 12/31/13.

Before it only took 2 1/2 hours to charge,now it takes almost 3 hours to make the battery full.
OK, I know it's a little late, but I've got a review for the HTC One. I've owned the Galaxy S3, the S4 and for 2 weeks now, the HTC One. 
 
 First of all, great build quality, excellent in the hand and it looks awesome.
 
 Battery endurance, pretty bad to be honest. In the evening I usually got about 30% left on the S4, the HTC is down below 10%.
 
 I'm really missing the S4's button on the front, it's a little annoying to have to grab the phone just to see what time it is. Also, the LED Notification only seems to work when charging.
 
 Camera is also pretty bad, compared to the S4. I am however seeing an improvement in autofocus department.
 
 The Notification bar is strange to me, it's annoying to have to push another button after it's pulled down, just to access the controls. 
 
 NFC doesn't seem to work for sending pictures. I miss the S-Beam from Samsung to be honest.(I know that's something else)
 
 Overall it's a good phone, it's fast, it's better optimised than the S4, I've always got enough RAM, but I miss some features from the Galaxy. Like Comfort Level, the thing where you put your hand above the screen to see time and notifications, the LED Notifications. For me it's like an Android iPhone to be honest. I'll take a Samsung any day of the week. I'm sorry but this is my honest opinion.; OK, I know it's a little late, but I've got a review for the HTC One. I've owned the Galaxy S3, the S4 and for 2 weeks now, the HTC One.; First of all, great build quality, excellent in the hand and it looks awesome.; Battery endurance, pretty bad to be honest. In the evening I usually got about 30% left on the S4, the HTC is down below 10%.; I'm really missing the S4's button on the front, it's a little annoying to have to grab the phone just to see what time it is. Also, the LED Notification only seems to work when charging.; Camera is also pretty bad, compared to the S4. I am however seeing an improvement in autofocus department.; The Notification bar is strange to me, it's annoying to have to push another button after it's pulled down, just to access the controls.; NFC doesn't seem to work for sending pictures.

Just update to 4.4.2 sense 6.0,
 features were improved but the display a bit bad.
 my main prob is what is the best data manager instead of HTC Sync Manager (HTC-SM), not much task/data can managed using HTC-SM.
 Any other program to share!?

This is a very good phone.

 The only problem I had is the camera. It takes pink pictures. Some people say you should replace it with warranty to fix the camera, too bad I already rooted my phone...

Just updated to 4.4.2 and Sense 6.0
 1. Battery
 With 4.3, battery life was a bit bad. But when I updated to 4.4, I noticed the battery life had improved. The next day I update the Sense 5.5 to Sense 6.0. Battery life became a bit bad though (it's like it's in the middle before and after I updated to 4.4.). WIFI is on all day long and I still have around 40%-50% at the end of the day. M7 got Extreme Power Saving mode too but haven't used it till date.
 2. Performance
 I noticed a minor lag but nothing serious. You can notice it but in the long term, it will become normal. Except that I never had that in 4.3...
 3. Camera
 Interface changed, but since I recently bought the M7, I didn't really had the opportunity to take lots of photos. There seems to be an improvement though.
 4. Music
 Music player is 'colorful'. Other than that, I didn't find major changes nor improvements. Sound output is pretty much the same. 
 5.Blinkfeed
 Yeah it's changed too. I had deactivated it in 4.3 and did it too in 4.4. Just checked it out earlier and it seems a bit better.
 
 I think I covered all the general matters. Loved the M7 since it came out. M8 just came out and we can sort of experience it on the M7. Didn't see any major differences with the 4.4 update but the Sense 6.0 definitely changed the outlook because it's the updated UI, silly me...

I love the HTC One. It is a fantastic phone. Yet the latest update makes me want to throw up in my mouth. The green and red colours are so tacky. Everything is sized so awkwardly.

Techno J, 21 May 2014EV setting is for adjust the exposure level. It's not directly affect the picture quality but ... moreThanks for reply I picked one up on way home 32gig silver second hand..
 
 Started charging it whilst setting up and then went out and it sunny in UK.Took some photos and video just using auto to see how things are..My pics were bit blurred on left side but video ok.Anyhow its lot better now had grease smears on lens.
 
 I think photos come out ok they will do for me all I want is a clear crisp shot with good contrast..Dont care about colour perfection etc..Video was clear and fluid..
 
 What is a shock is how bare the phone is compared to Samsung (had an S5 recently but returned it)..It is almost stock Android..I thought speakers would be a lot louder than what HTC are promoting as booming sound..Screen is pin sharp and that's it for now need to set up properly..It does get warm but that does not bother me one bit,,quadcore and transistors switching on and off 1.6 biilion times a second and no fan or heatsink except aluminium housing its masterpiece.
 
 I wonder how long I will keep this?

faris k, 17 May 2014what should be looked before buying used htc one>? PLS HELP ME>>>Sorry, I'm not an htc one m7 owner. But I know fully about it as I've used it for one week. I own an s4 octa. 
 
 Last summer I needed to buy a new phone and was confused between htc one and s4. Both are great phones. I did a lot of research and finally chose a product which suited me. 
 
 If you are eyeing for htc one m7, the only other phone you should look for is the s4. Now s4 also has 2 versions. I9500 or octa and i9505 or the LTE version. 
 
 Build quality and design: htc one is better. 
 
 UI: I prefer Samsung's touchwiz over htc sense. But your choice may be different. 
 
 Battery life: s4 is better
 
 Screen: s4 has a better screen with adjustable color gamut, perfect blacks and whites and more sunlight legibility. 
 
 Performance: both are quite good. But I prefer m7 as it is slightly faster. But s4 has a better processor. So it will play games and high end apps better. 
 
 Speaker: htc one has a better sound. But s4 is louder. In the end I'll prefer htc one in speaker as it sounds just great.
 
 Audio quality: The htc one is better than i9505 s4 but worse than i9500 s4. Anyways, all the three are very good.
 
 Camera: s4 obviously. The m7 is garbage in camera compared to s4.

In North America the HTC One (M7) just got an Update to HTC Sense 6. 
 
 Now the M7 has most of the Software Features that the M8 has (obviously the added Features for the second "Aperture" (on the Back) are not available on the M7).
 
 The default Theme (after Update and ReBoot) is ugly flat green, so go into your Personalization and change your Theme (and reset your Wallpaper).
 
 The "Weather" (Main Screen) seems broken and will not update (hopefully it is a temporary Server problem and we will not need yet another Update to fix it). If you do not like the Weather well now you are set !
 
 The Camera adds a BUNCH of new Features including the STRANGE "Make-up Level" (which I will not use for Selfies, nor take Selfies in any event). ;) .

 As you might know, I live in a hostel far from the huge tv of home. So I have just 2 options for watching movies. Laptop and phone. Both are at 1080p. But I prefer dark movies/tv shows on phone in darkness and sleeping in bed. OLED helps a great deal here. I need media on the go and hence loads of storage. So the 32 gb m7 can't work for me. And for the audio quality, the m7 and i9505 come with qualcomm DAC whereas i9500 comes with an advanced wolfson DAC which is better and I'm an audiophile so it's important for me. I've done some tweaks in developer settings and my s4 is now quite fast. Is not on par with m7 though. But I don't care. As I previously said, multi window, group play and s health are must haves for me. Plus the notification area on s4 is useful. 
 
 I don't care about battery life and speakers. My laptop will blow m7 out of water. The most important feature is camera for me as I am a college student and don't own a dslr or mirrorless cam. I take a lot of pics. To give an idea, my album since I purchased the phone is 17.8 GB. And the m7's camera is utter crap. 
 
 I don't call at all. My 50 INR talktime lasts a month. The calls are just where you are type 10 sec calls and I don't care as the s4 is sufficiently good at it. 
 
 That's how I justify my purchase. So stop telling that I prefer quality. I also prefer quality over quantity but I need the phone to be good at what I do. I am a very advanced user and hence expect a lot from my phone. 
 
 In the end, to each its own. M7 is good for you and s4 works good for me.

 And one more HUGE plus of the M7 is the call quality. The top speaker of it provides a brilliant in call experience, S4 or any Samsung phone, or Z2, can't even come anywhere near it!
 
 My main purpose of using this phone is definitely for business, but that doesn't mean I won't use it for multimedia purposes. Yes, I don't watch videos on my mobile screen, find them horrible small, nor I hear music via speakers, but I browse a lot.
 
 To me, I am not seeing this phone as a downgrade from S4 at all! I honestly don't know why I kept purchasing Samsung, maybe it was for the OLED display, God knows!
 
 I never used Smart Stay, Smart Pause, Smart Scroll, practically they never worked! I never used that multi window feature, however I like the idea. I rarely used the the camera! The only feature which I used was the Screen Mirroring, not by a huge extent though. And that later was killed with root after KitKat release. Samsung R&D should be fired right now, they release stuffs first, test it later.
 
 Not a single feature of TouchWiz was polished, nor I used them, don't really get the point. User experience is the only thing I care about, and that was horribly lacking from S4. What CPU it is running, Octa core or dual core was irrelevant, same goes for GPU.
 
 There are two types of need for two types of people, one believe and go with the idea of quantity over quality and the other choose quality over quantity. I definitely belong to the latter category, always did, always will.; Umm, not really sure what you mean about audio quality. Audio quality is great on M7, on par with S4, I mean with headphones obviously.; And one more HUGE plus of the M7 is the call quality. The top speaker of it provides a brilliant in call experience, S4 or any Samsung phone, or Z2, can't even come anywhere near it!; My main purpose of using this phone is definitely for business, but that doesn't mean I won't use it for multimedia purposes. Yes, I don't watch videos on my mobile screen, find them horrible small, nor I hear music via speakers, but I browse a lot.; To me, I am not seeing this phone as a downgrade from S4 at all! I honestly don't know why I kept purchasing Samsung, maybe it was for the OLED display, God knows!; I never used Smart Stay, Smart Pause, Smart Scroll, practically they never worked! I never used that multi window feature, however I like the idea. I rarely used the the camera! The only feature which I used was the Screen Mirroring, not by a huge extent though.

 But you've asked it here. So yes, they'll receive those features which will be compatible. Like ultra power saving mode requires amoled screen, so it will be there. But don't expect the new camera ui or hybrid AF as they are hardware dependent. The new touchwiz will obviously come as soon as we get the update and it will be great as it will clear 3 gb bloat as well as the new touchwiz is much much smoother and fast. 
 
 Don't expect all features but all which are compatible will come and the ui will obviously change. That's the only reason why I'm keeping my phone for 1 year more. 
 
 The sane thing happened when s4 released and some features were given to s3 along with the ui but not all. That's Samsung's policy.

Plus those videos have the i9505 which is quite slower than i9500. So they don't do justice. Plus I've used m7 myself and it's not much faster. It's faster no doubt, but not by much after kitkat.
 
 according to your needs, performance and vanilla android, did you look at nexus 5. It's much faster than m7 and the camera is also ok. Plus it'll heat up less than m7 as m7 heats up due to less efficient s600 SoC. The nexus 5 has snapdragon 800 and is a real speed beast. If any phone can match the speed and smoothness of m8 and s5, is nexus 5.

Saurav Ghosh, 12 May 2014Lol, no pal, didn't hit any stone. I am going for this after an super extensive search for ... moreOhh. Yes that's true to some extent. But with the kitkat update and doing some tweaks
 in developer options, my s4 has become quite smooth. Actually I exchanged my s4 with a friend's m7 for a week and the experience was kinda bad. The screen is small and not upto the mark and the camera has a purple hue in low light and is practically unusable in most scenarios. Battery life is also slight less and ui Has just too less options. I missed the notification bar too much. Audio quality was not on par with s4 as the adapt sound is much better than that beats audio. 
 
 The one had quite good advantages though. It doesn't lag in system apps and it's fast. The speakers are great for calls and casual use and the design, absolutely great. I fell in love with it. 
 
 I use all of the features like multi window, group play and s health and simply can't leave them. Additionally, the bloat in touchwiz is quite less in the new touchwiz(s5) and I'll get an update soon. The s5 is as smooth as an m8 just the animations are slower which can be fastened in dev options. 
 
 Ohh, and that great cpu opens apps faster, does video decoding much better and captures 120 fps 720p video and can play that at any speed. The octa core heats up but provides an awful amount of RAW power that opens and plays non system apps faster. Touchwiz can only make system apps slower but the downloaded apps will be faster on s4 due to cortex a15.
 
 You are completely right, 
 To each is own. HTC is not for me. I use my smartphone much for multimedia and you for your business. So we both have completely different needs and hence need different phones. I need a seriously powerful ui and touchwiz is the only one that offers such power like the floating video player, brightness slider in notifications and these small features make my life really easy. 
 
 Moto x is just fast and these features take a great hit on battery life. Plus a 720p screen and selling it at a high price are not very great decisions by Moto. 
 
 You have made a right decision. Have a good time. Don't mind sharing your experience once you get it.

[deleted post]Lol, no pal, didn't hit any stone.
 
 I am going for this after an super extensive search for four days, and I was literally shocked to see how could a device like Moto X, which is just 370 USD could outperform a top line flagship like S4, M7, G2 etc. That was just the most surprising thing I have ever seen. So that was the turning point for me. I kept defending Samsung and their TouchWiz for too long, but they do know how to frak up a device with their insanely heavy and bloated TouchWiz. I hated Android because of lags, but I simply had no idea that it lags because of TouchWiz. Sense isn't perfect either, it definitely is worse than Vanilla Android pure experience, but in comparison with TW, well YouTube has plenty videos comparing S4 and M7, kindly see those.
 
 I was going for Moto X to be honest. That is one beautiful piece of idea. Active notification, WOW. A compact and beautiful design, so easy to hold and all, but it let me down with it's really bad camera, 720p display and no root for KitKat yet. So I went for M7. Cause M8 is way too big for me. I need a phone which I will be able to use with one hand comfortably. Also I wanted a sturdy built phone, which M7 is, I don't think there is any other phone other than M8 which could come even close to these. Build quality is a huge thing for me, I don't baby my phones. I needed a strong vibrating device. It seems by reviews M7 is just that. I don't care what specs it have, what's the point of having an octa, or double octa core CPU if it can't perform fluidly? At least it doesn't make any sense to me, nor it will in future. To me the only 'downgrade' happened in the camera section from S4 to M7, that won't have any impact on me as I take around ten photos in a month, sometimes not even that.
 
 To each his own. To me, I am done with features. Performance is the main thing, always was for me, I just didn't know what I was missing! Thanks to the S4 for giving me horrible experience so that I did some research further. Jeez Samsung, focus on Tizen will ya? Android isn't your cup of tea, at all.
 
 I will use the M7 for around six to seven months, then I will check the newer version of Moto X whatever it will be called, whatever it is, it will be a pure Android phone for me.
 
 Other than the size of M8, the ongoing topics about the build quality concern and cheap lens drove me off from it, also on reddit people said M8 has lower vibration intensity than M7! Also I valued the money, paying 80% extra than what I got for S4 to upgrade to M8 was just ridiculous for me.
 
 The above are all my view. I did take a hit on my head, but not with any stone, with some practicality ;) Thanks to all the great reviewers of YouTube.
 
 Anyone can buy anything. If you like S5 go buy it, if someone else like M8 go buy it, heck buy even iPhone if you want, I certainly don't care any more.; Lol, no pal, didn't hit any stone.; I am going for this after an super extensive search for four days, and I was literally shocked to see how could a device like Moto X, which is just 370 USD could outperform a top line flagship like S4, M7, G2 etc. That was just the most surprising thing I have ever seen.

My daughter and I bought the HTC ONE the day it was released last year. I started having issues right away with mine. They didn't clear up do I exchanged it for the S4 which I love.
 My daughter opted to keep her HTC ONE and now it is completely dead. It acts as though it is charging and gets hot but it will not come back on.
 I feel it is the battery. However, anyone who has had experience with this phone knows you cannot open it to replace the battery. It is sealed and needs to be sent to the manufacturer for whatever repairs are needed. Including a battery replacement.
 Dumb!!!!!
 This phone started getting bad about as soon as she had it for a year and was part the time to send it in and out course beyond exchange time of 30 days. After a year I took the insurance... (BIG MISTAKE on my part for this phone!!)...off because we paid off the $600.00 phone (not worth the price imo)
 It definitely had the best features that is one reason we waited until the day it was released to purchase it!
 I/we will NEVER buy another HTC product! 
 I would not recommend this phone to anyone.

Anonymous, 01 May 2014planing to buy this what about its camera qualitySame here. I sold my S4 yesterday after using it for eight months. I was seeing the picture comparison between the M7 and S4 for a long time yesterday, and for day photos the difference is almost night and day. The S4 captures way more details than the M7, so if you are a person who crops images then there's no doubt that M7 will not do the job at all. If your photos end up at Facebook or some community site then M7 photos will pass.
 
 However the night shots were really good, less noise than S4, but again the captured details are lost. What I found great though were the close up / macro shots, they were brilliant, and you will be able to focus really close to the subject, with my S4 I could never do that.
 At the end of the day it depends how much cell phone camera matters to you, if it has a good amount of usage and is the only camera then you might wanna think twice before getting this. I for myself don't care about camera, but even after that I am thinking twice about getting this phone, undoubtedly it's a great device, but the camera surely is a let down. Don't know what went through hTC's head to go for the Ultra Pixel thing but sometimes you need to go with the flow, all mobile camera sensors are tiny, they can NEVER match the quality of a large sized P&S sensor, let alone the m4/3 and SLRs, so the only way mobile cameras can make up for the image quality are by putting a high resolution sensor, which S4 has done, Z1,Z2 has done, all the Lumia line-up has done, but hTC, well they were arrogant, and that will cost them some good amount of market share. If the M7 had a 8 megapixel decent snapper I'd happily get it and proudly say the eff word to my S4.

Its a Great looking phone, but that's all it is.
 It has worst Hardware Quality i have ever experienced in a premium electronic device.
 
 Unlike other mobile manufacturers HTC has the most reddiculas Customer Service Policy.
 
 My Experience:
 
 1. Hardware issues occoured in the first month of purchase.
 2. The device had too many issues and has gone through a very heavy hardware repaire and replacement since purchase.
 3. Misleading information by HTC sales in the first week of purchase about a hardware issue being a software, to avoide refund/replacement.
 4. Multiple Service center repair caused more damage instead of fixing the issues.
 5. Customer service people never have any case history to refer to. Which leads to a new start every time you call.
 6. Customer service reps are hopeless and yet they are the only one a customer can contact, supervisors are never available, and when they are you hardly can make out the difference.
 7. Fake promises made by customer service about escalating the matter to concerned team and arranging a call back or arrangin a standby device. Out of 50 calls I've made , only once I received the callback.
 8. when asked for supervisor at customer service people say that we are the escalation managers and there is none of us.
 9. no or nonsense reply to e-mails, massages, complaints whatsoever.
 
 10. After approval of replacement, they sent low quality- duplicate looking phone, when refused to accept the sent another. 6 time in a row i was given that duplicate material and finally i had to loudge a complaint with consumer court. 
 
 Inshort: Their product and service SUCKS. Its another Chinese phone company.
 
 Better go for some relible vendors like NOKIA, IPHONE, 
 SONY ECT... i would even recommend micromax anyday over HTC. :); Its a Great looking phone, but that's all it is.; It has worst Hardware Quality i have ever experienced in a premium electronic device.; Unlike other mobile manufacturers HTC has the most reddiculas Customer Service Policy.; My Experience:; 1.

I'd only had my phone a few weeks when my son had his wedding. Assured there would be a photographer, I didn't bring a camera, the photographer didn't show. We were all using our phones and sending the pictures to each other and the bride. In all of the craziness I received this one picture of my son on my lap, and while I thought we were hugging he was kissing me on my cheek!!! I hadn't had a kiss like that since he was 5! Here is my problem:
 1) In using my new phone, I chose an option, which was one of the only 2 it gave me.
 2) The phone gave me an option of saving it as wallpaper or emailing it. (At the time I should have emailed it to myself, but I was getting hit with tons of pictures at that moment so I said 'wallpaper' & now I can't get it from there onto my gallery, to email, nothing. The others I sent to my email.
 3) Everytime I see the picture and think I might lose it I almost cry. Please help me.
 4) I called the HTC number AT&T gave me and stayed on hold for 67 minutes and 04 seconds. The AT&T guy said he didn't even know what to do so he gave me the number and wished me luck.
 I was learning many things about my phone at the time and did not backup anything for fear of erasing it after I did so. I only knew one other person with a phone like mine and she was no help.
 Recently, I was sent a pic via Facebook and when I clicked on it I was given the option of wallpaper or email. The wedding was in July 2013, and I cannot find who sent it to me.

 I have my HTC one for about 2 months now, and in the beginning everything was great, battery life great, i was really impressed.
 In the last two weeks or so, my battery has gone crazy. I charge it to 100% (overnight) and as soon as i unplug it in a few hours it will be down to 0 even though the use was normal (mainly texting on whatsapp or it was on standby) 
 Another thing that happened was i put it to charge, and i woke up in the middle of the night and saw it was fully charged, I left it on the charger and continued sleeping. When i woke up in the morning my phone was off and it was charging 10% 
 Also, unrelated to the battery the Camera app sometimes has a bugg and when i try to open it it will open, and close and a notification will appear that says "battery unable to open"
 
 Is anybody else having these problems??
 Id greatly appreciate any advice. :); Can someone please help me?; I have my HTC one for about 2 months now, and in the beginning everything was great, battery life great, i was really impressed.; In the last two weeks or so, my battery has gone crazy.

I've been using HTC One for several months now. So far, so good except that since the KitKat upgrade the battery seems to drain faster and takes longer to charge. The camera's focusing is slowed too -- it spends a lot of time trying to focus on even still objects. Hopefully they'll come out with a fix.; I've been using HTC One for several months now.

This Mobile more wonderful ... this is my impression of my experience to Mobile for about two weeks 
 
 * Excellent screen 
 * Pure sound, but it is not up to the extent that some people think may, of course, but easily audible 
 * Voice calls gorgeous and very clear, whatever the crowds or noise 
 * A very stylish and the perfect size and high quality materials 
 * Battery lasts me a full day and probably last for a day and a half depending on usage .. I use the Web via Wi-Fi for a period of 4 to 6 hours a day with some of the calls and sometimes some photos 
 In any case, the battery life is the same duration of the Galaxy Note 3 I use the same but I did not try any games, because I do not care generally 
 * The camera is very good too, but in Note 3 was better 
 * Smoothness and lack of halos and speed in the open any application, as well as surfing the net 
 * Android experience on this mobile and htc devices are generally quite different 
 * Technical support from htc very respectable, and I have a problem in the touch buttons below the screen were not issued vibration when touched .. sent email and the next day was the reply solution, something more wonderful

Personally, I think HTC One is one of the most amazing phones in the market. I've been using it for a few months now and this slice of perfection seems to satisfy all my needs except for the video quality at dim light. So worth its prize, I found minimum lag and it's definitely better than the iPhone 5 (which btw doesn't even provide a Bluetooth option, one of the primary requirements in a phone). iPhone 5 may be classy but if you're smart you'd go for this Android beauty.; Personally, I think HTC One is one of the most amazing phones in the market.

eternal21391, 24 Feb 2014I have 17gb of free spaceI think your issue is caused by the internet. Ensure that when downloading the update, your connection should be solid, not intermittent. (but on the other hand, i also believe that the download is caching, so even if you "lost" the internet, it will still continue the last packet of its download), so try to close all applications first, by double tapping the home button and flicking those "waiting" applicaions; I think your issue is caused by the internet.

This the best smartphone in the market of 2013. The aluminium premium body, the excellent boomsound speakers, the Sense experience it truly great. It's been one year with this great smartphone and I will not let it go. For sure, the new update make the phone more quickly, accessible and truly amazing. The new phones that are coming in with the Snapdragon 800 and 2.2 or 2.3 Ghz are not a solution for a change. That's why HTC is here for the change.; This the best smartphone in the market of 2013.

I love this phone completely though the last update is just annoying to piss hell with the changes to gallery and to sending files. It had simple, easy to sort and be organized folders at rows of two across, three down on the screen originally where the folder name was very easy to read and the images inside were rows of four across. It's updated for style over function and organization to overly large bars where if the last image had a white section was IMPOSSIBLE to read the folder name and rows of three images.

Got this phone on November went back to Target only bcos manager promise to give me free headphone and faceplate. Daaaa...not only he didn't give me what was promise he gave me open box phone. I tried to come back to the same person after about 1 week tried to tell him something is wrong with the phone he promise phone is new and nothing wrong with it. Now the problem is cathing up on me. Not only it freezes on me when trying to go facebook, google, or dialing, it takes a couple of times to touch home again to go back to where you started. WIFI IS A BIG Problem like everyone else is having, tried to call HTC they screwed up my phone even more. HTC Rep, was rude, yelling on the phone constantly, being sarcastic, and doesn't know what his talking about, after telling him that I do not want to wipe out everything I have on the phone because it has all video and pictures of my children, he goes and put my phone on safe mode and tell me "ok we gonna start from scracth and wipe your phone out" what part of my english does this guy did not understand? I'm so mad, called the manager right away that gave me this phone. I will not take this damm phone back all they gonna do is plug it in a computer reader to findout what is wrong with it, if nothing shows, they will not even try to fix it return it to the store and return it right back at you.

Hi everyone,
 I came to see review section of htc one and i found lot of complaints about galaxy s4. Are you serious that you are complaining about s4 on htc page???
 
 Many people are commenting against s4 on this page and comparing their htc one with it. They want to prove that their phone is better than s4.
 
 I don't say i have used htc and i don't even complain about that by giving fake opinions. But i want to say that people complaining about galaxy s4 are speaking lie. I am using galaxy s4 for 8 months, and i want to say that there is no problem with it till now. 
 
 People says that s4 gets heated, so does laptop and computer what's the big deal in it. Every hardware with big specs get heated and people who says that htc one doesn't get heated while playing heaving games like- asphalt 7, dark knight rises... are speaking lie.
 
 Then come to hardware. Htc is having really good built in quality as compared to hardware. But i want to ask a question. What happens if your phones drops, doesn't it get scratches? 
 If phone fells on a hard surface, it gets deep scratches which cannot be removed from the phone and you have to live with it, but in case of galaxy s4, you can change the back of your smartphone.
 
 Then it comes to Touchwiz, who says that its laggy? Till 8 months of use my phone didn't even rebooted one time. Specially after 4.3 update my phone become faster. Some people are having problem so does htc users have. 
 
 i want to say that stop complaining about other phones, just look at your phones, if you are not satisfied with your phone then don't mislead others that your phone is better than other company's phone. If one can buy galaxy s4, then he can even buy htc one. 
 
 At last i want to say that just write for s4 if you have used it. Even if you go in galaxy s4 opinions, you will rarely find a comment about htc one, because none of the galaxy user cares about it.; Hi everyone,; I came to see review section of htc one and i found lot of complaints about galaxy s4.

I've never understand why people don't see that HTC develops superior quality devices, the construction of this phone is amazing, the full aluminium body in a surprisingly light phone is really more than what I expected to be. The sense 5 is quite nice, makes it look very elegant and stylish.

Have you compared the app drawer layout of sense 4 which has nicely contoured icons and three beautiful green/blue colored tabs for All,Frequent and Downloads,with that of sense 5.Sense 4 layout looks awesome.Sense 5 app drawer layout looks almost similar to stock android UI layout and is dull and boring. So I dont like to buy the latest htc phones which has sense 5 UI.I will wait for sense 6 if it looks better or as good as sense 4, I'll buy that htc phone with the best design and specs.If sense 6 layout doesnt look better than sense 4, I'll buy HTC One X/X Plus or Butterfly which are the high speced phones having sense 4 UI.

had a bad experience with this phone. 
 the phone had bad camera modul and the picture taken with this phone is unusable due to very bad purple tint. 
 HTC Indonesia refused to replace the unit due to limited supply or so they said. and they offered free repair instead. 
 the repair itself took months since they had to send it back to Taiwan to replace the camera modul (i guess HTC Indonesia is just sales representative only, they don't have service center here). 
 
 really, now i understand why HTC market share goes down every year.

Purple/pink tint was a hardware issue and HTC fixed it in 1 week in the UK. Just call HTC support and they will arrange a pick up and drop off free of charge if under warranty.

hTc is currently fixing this purple tint issue via hardware repair. You must call their customer care support line. They'll issue you a ticket but you're responsible for sending the phone in and they'll repair it if it's still under warranty. No software update will fix this (not jelly bean 4.3 or even Kitkat 4.4). You can also have it exchanged through your carrier if it's still under warranty but there's no way of guaranteeing that your replacement won't have same issue.; hTc is currently fixing this purple tint issue via hardware repair.

 1)Camera: although it is what so called Ultrapixel, but seriously 4 mega pixels aren't enough specially if you want to zoom through photos you capture.
 2)Camera also: Ultrapixels were disigned by HTC to capture more light, therefore you can get better pictures in low light right? And the answer is no way because the HTC One was plagued by a purple tint camera issue that trashes your pictures right away. I already replaced my phone 4 times and the problem persists (it is definitely a hardware issue however).
 3)Battery life: from light to medium use it will last you a full day with about 3-4 hours of screen time, but if you are a heavy user just like me then you will need to charge it at least twice a day.
 3)Charging speed: This phone has a miserable charging speed. It takes about 3.5 hours to charge while in standby mode, and an additional hour while using it.
 Plus don't think that you can buy a 2A charger or whatever, because it doesn't support Qualcomm quick charge so you won't be getting more than 1A charger.
 4)Design (not build quality): you can notice that although the screen is 4.7 inches but the phone size is same in size of the galaxy s4 which packs a 5 inch screen (if not a bit taller) because of the wide bezels and stereo speakers, and awkwardly placed power button. It's just not comfortable for a one handed user like me (this is my opinion).
 5)Speakers: I really appreciate the loud sound and the beats audio integration and the amazing sound quality which is the best on a phone, but the minimum volume (the first step above 0) is really loud specially if you wanna play games with a bit of sound. It's really annoying.
 And here are the pros:
 1)Build quality: no one can argue about the build quality of this phone, it's really a nice looking phone and of course it feels premium.
 2)Speakers: the loudness of those speaker and the build quality won't disappoint you at all when showing of ;)
 3)Smooth UI: compared to other UIs this is one of the smoothest UIs.
 4)Screen: It is the sharpest display on the market now with a pixel density of 468, and the super LCD3 is gorgeous no over saturation (like the AMOLED) no washed out colors (like the TFT) it is pretty accurate and vibrant.
 I'm not a fanboy of any corporation, I'm just telling what I like and dislike about this device.; Hey, I am an HTC One owner.

hello
 this is my second Htc One as the first that i had i sold it to buy the "amazing " galaxy s4...
 i so regreted this decission because at that time i have already swapped a s4 due to the bad experiences i encountered..still at that point i decided to give the s4 nother chance ,maybe i had a bad device...as it turned out my first experience and the observations that i made were corect again...this made me feel even worse because i sold my Htc One...
 i never had any problems with Htc,no matter what model i bought and used from them and i pretty much can be considered a loyalist of this company...ever since i hold my first Htc Diamond until now,even though through the years i used a lot of Samsungs ,Apples and Nokias...
 the only companies that i trust completely when buying a phone are Nokia and Htc..
 i' ve read a lots of comments in here where people complain about a lot of things,from slow charging to camera problems and overheating....i never encountered any of this problems ..i consider this device to be the best Android device i have ever owned,and i owned a lot,and this is the only Android device WITHOUT LAG!!!no lag at all...comparing this to the s4 or any other sammy this is a supercar...everything i want to do,i do it with speed...no slowness,no problems at all..
 battery life...well comparing this with the s4, from my experience,i must say that although it has a smaller battery it lasts longer...so for me this is a clear winner,no doubt...it easily beats the s4 in this regard 
 camera...a lot of people complain about the 4ULTRApixel camera with no reason...i also own right now a Nokia 808 and i can say that nothing is capable to beat this "monster",but still the Htc One's camera is one of the best camera's i used in a smartphone...it has great quality,both on stills and video...the images are great ,i made some really great pictures with this phone,and in night time photos it easily beats my Nokia 808 ...you really need to know your twchnology and fully understand it in order to use it properly,but i guess it's easier to complain and bash something if you don't know how to use it...
 built quality....no1! the best phone on the market in this aspect! nothing comes close to this....i owned the ip5 and everybody praisses Apple for the build quality( i don't know why) and the Htc One is a clear winner also here...
 sound...no1 again!exceptional!nothing like this exists on the market both on the speakers or the headphones...amazing quality...i always loved htc 's music reproduction in the headphones starting with the sensation xe ...
 this is by far the smoothest,the fastest,the best experience on android that i ever had since ever so i can highly recommend this amazing phone to everyone out there who wants quality..and a piece of advice: when purchasing an Htc phone,always buy the ones that say Made in Taiwan..they are the ones that are really high quality and desrve your money not ones made in china...i know from experience that whatever is made in china you have about 50% chance to have some serious headakes...; hello; this is my second Htc One as the first that i had i sold it to buy the "amazing " galaxy s4...; i so regreted this decission because at that time i have already swapped a s4 due to the bad experiences i encountered..still at that point i decided to give the s4 nother chance ,maybe i had a bad device...as it turned out my first experience and the observations that i made were corect again...this made me feel even worse because i sold my Htc One...; i never had any problems with Htc,no matter what model i bought and used from them and i pretty much can be considered a loyalist of this company...ever since i hold my first Htc Diamond until now,even though through the years i used a lot of Samsungs ,Apples and Nokias...; the only companies that i trust completely when buying a phone are Nokia and Htc..; i' ve read a lots of comments in here where people complain about a lot of things,from slow charging to camera problems and overheating....i never encountered any of this problems ..i consider this device to be the best Android device i have ever owned,and i owned a lot,and this is the only Android device WITHOUT LAG!!!no lag at all...comparing this to the s4 or any other sammy this is a supercar...everything i want to do,i do it with speed...no slowness,no problems at all..; battery life...well comparing this with the s4, from my experience,i must say that although it has a smaller battery it lasts longer...so for me this is a clear winner,no doubt...it easily beats the s4 in this regard; camera...a lot of people complain about the 4ULTRApixel camera with no reason...i also own right now a Nokia 808 and i can say that nothing is capable to beat this "monster",but still the Htc One's camera is one of the best camera's i used in a smartphone...it has great quality,both on stills and video...the images are great ,i made some really great pictures with this phone,and in night time photos it easily beats my Nokia 808 ...you really need to know your twchnology and fully understand it in order to use it properly,but i guess it's easier to complain and bash something if you don't know how to use it...; built quality....no1! the best phone on the market in this aspect! nothing comes close to this....i owned the ip5 and everybody praisses Apple for the build quality( i don't know why) and the Htc One is a clear winner also here...; sound...no1 again!exceptional!nothing like this exists on the market both on the speakers or the headphones...amazing quality...i always loved htc 's music reproduction in the headphones starting with the sensation xe ...; this is by far the smoothest,the fastest,the best experience on android that i ever had since ever so i can highly recommend this amazing phone to everyone out there who wants quality..and a piece of advice: when purchasing an Htc phone,always buy the ones that say Made in Taiwan..they are the ones that are really high quality and desrve your money not ones made in china...i know from experience that whatever is made in china you have about 50% chance to have some serious headakes...

Ok for those buying this phone 
 I would say just perfect not because i own it i also own an s4 and let me tell u these benchmarks and processors dont matter its the user interface 
 The new sense 5.5 is just super amazing fast battery life is wayy better then s4 and some android phones it works for about 12 hours with good use wifi amd stuff about 5 hours or more screentime its just perfect the camera is decent great if u want to upload photos but not good compared to s4 camera but on paper is doesnot matter
 The build is supreme sound is just amazing
 I managed to convince 5 other people 2 from iphone 5 and 4s one from s4 and 2 from nokia 920 and 800 they were all like super unique design two of them were sold on the beautiful sound if u are a regular photographer with zoom stuff etc and closeups i would say its normal night photos with flash are just extraordinary 
 For those with tint i swear that i have this phone sjnce 3 weeks and no problem 
 I certainly dont like samsung software so i sold note 2 and i have to tell u that was once the best phone i had.... I bought is for around 600$ new and i have tk tell u as a expert advisor buy this phone ots camera beats the z1 google htc one vs z1 xda camera comparisson
 And see for urself there is no charging problem just use orignal charger on normal use texting and photos is works for 24 hours and for me it works for a whole day very easyily i listen to music alot so that takes the battery too..
 Night photograaphh like at tine of dawn aur dusk or modnight etc us justt amazing
 For focusing its a little slow but there is a technique like just wheb u tap to foucus hit the shutter while flash is on thsts the part where the photos are amazi g 
 For perfect photo u just have to take the best point whete there is the right amount of focus thats all indoor
 More sophiticated very unique design
 I have balck bht prefer silver as it gives more rich look 
 Black is like super stealth like batman
 It has black matte finsih there is no silver problem i droped it twice one on clean marble facedown and no scratch
 For those i woould say just whehn desire hd was released it was all new technology

Hey guys. I am looking to upgrade from my HTC Sensation (which performs quite badly for me with internet dropouts happening very often). I narrowed my choices down to HTC One, GS4 and LG G2. On paper they look very similar, however I DO like the build quality of the HTC. What is holding me back is that many people report quality issues (such as speakers breaking or gaps in the body) and this makes me quite worried because I don't want to spend $600 and be stuck with a dud for 2 years. Is this something to be worried about or just a vocal minority, or maybe carrier specific version having bad quality?; Hey guys.

HI guys....
 First thing don’t compare Android phones to IOS & windows phones. Cause with 512 RAM windows & IOS phones can run very well then Android phones (which having 512 RAM).
 Compare the phones with in same range and OS. 
 Apple: - Having great OS ever (till now) IOS, Siri – No virtual Assistant can beat it, rich applications, having great body & more compactable, smooth performance. 
 Cons: - No memory card, price, less apps
 Sony: - water proof & dust proof, good camera, really good display, maintaining good built quality. (Especially SP & Z series)
 Cons: - To much big Bezel (4.5 inches phone is equal to 5” inches other brand phones), sharp edges, bad battery backup (Not ZR & SP), screen protection (less when compare to gorilla glass), Not customizable. 
 Samsung: - maintaining very good sensors, Price, easy to use, good AMOLED display, hitting with a lot of models. (S series & notes)
 Cons: - Almost every mobile looks like same, built quality is bad.
 HTC: - excellent beat Audio, beautiful display, feather touch, good looking models.
 Cons: - Very sensitive will get lot of repairs.
 Nokia: - best Windows phones, good in camera. (Lumia series)
 Cons: - Heavy Body, Very less apps, Not easy to use.
 LG: - To be frank only LG G2, Nexus 4 & 5 are good phones.
 Blackberry: - best business purpose phone.
 Motorola: - Once upon a time it was king unfortunately not now. (My first mobile)
 In my opinion best mobiles now are Apple: 5 & 5S; Sony: Z1 & ZR; Samsung: S4 & S3; HTC: One & One Mini; Nokia: 520,720,920; LG: Nexus 4&5, LG G2; Blackberry: Z10, Z30; Motorola: Droid series & Moto X & Defy; HI guys....; First thing don’t compare Android phones to IOS & windows phones.

And the warranty service here sucks you have to wait a month or so to get your unit back for repair and guess what still the issue is their or the issue will be return after a month. HTC had really done bad on this phone..

This phone looked great but the syncing problems are unbelievable - I have spent hours on the phone with their help service which is hopeless. Worked one day and then failed the next. If they can't work it out what is the use of this phone and how dare they sell a defective product. Just wish I had stuck with iPhone which worked. Looks like chuck it away and put it down to experience; This phone looked great but the syncing problems are unbelievable - I have spent hours on the phone with their help service which is hopeless.

Hi guys. I owned this phone once. I admired the premium and sturdy built quality. Then, came the camera problem with red and purple tint everytime in average to low light. So ,i held on hoping a software update will resolve the issues. Alas, to no avail.

Hoping HTC One Max doesn't have this issue, then i will go and buy the phone. That is all. Bye..; Hi guys. I owned this phone once. I admired the premium and sturdy built quality.

Have been using this phone for over 5 months and I am simply loving the phone. As I have been reading the reviews posted by many users.. I do not have a pink tint issue with my phone. It has never hanged even after having more then 100apps/games installed. I feel @ this very point of time.. This is undisputed winner in the matter of classy, smart, look and feel and not to forget amazing camera. Use flash if u want to click low light images because phones are not suppose to be your photography instrument only. Get a good dslr if u want to enjoy taking pictures... But I still love htc camera u just need to review and customize your settings. Enjoying the phone and no complaints.

Also if i see the pixels in the picture once i put to the computer its 4 MP, 2688 x 1520. Even if i take pictures in nights the picture brightness may increase still pictures are not quality. Other than that phone is great but i feel i using a 4MP camera phone at the end.; I have this phone. But i have to tell the camera is disappointing.

Hey!!!!!
 i love the htc one, its brilliant, with a massive screen great keyboard, and lovely sound!!
 Just one thing I dont like is not having the option to turn off the auto capital letter at the begining of every sentance. Slightly annoying, i used to have it until their was a software update. If htc could bring that back it would be great, and also different system fonts. That would be cool to!!! Other than that, phone is fantastic.; Hey!!!!!; i love the htc one, its brilliant, with a massive screen great keyboard, and lovely sound!!; Just one thing I dont like is not having the option to turn off the auto capital letter at the begining of every sentance.

 Camera produces good result in "Good Light" conditions.
 
 However, at night , it's just like any other mobile phone camera. Just average at night time!
 
 
 Also, HTC One is not that much user friendly, I switched from Samsung S2 to HTC One and found it quite hard.
 Hope it helps!; Andy,; Camera produces good result in "Good Light" conditions.; However, at night , it's just like any other mobile phone camera. Just average at night time!; Also, HTC One is not that much user friendly, I switched from Samsung S2 to HTC One and found it quite hard.; Hope it helps!
I have this phone with me since One month.
 
 Previously I was Samsung Galaxy S2 user.
 
 PROS:
 -Well HTC One phone is definitely very nice in its looks
 -HTC Zoe is a new feature which creates an auto video compiled from your gallery, you can set the theme and music. It really puts life to image gallery of your 
 phone
 -Camera is very nice in good light conditions but at night its just an average one
 -Under Original OS, performance was quite good. I went for upgrade then the performance went down a little
 -Its got a new feature which is like a dashboard of your selected apps like facebook, twitter, CNN etc etc
 -Audio beats put really a great audio quality in listening music. You can forget IPOD after having this
 
 Cons
 -Battery dries out very quickly if wifi or data mode is enabled. I have to charge it two times a day if I am using wifi regularly in a day
 -Night Time Camera result is not great and its just like an other mobile camera which performs poorly at night
 - Definitely it lacks an ease of use. You need to read tutorials to know about specific functionality. E.g. You need to remember two fingers swipe and three fingers swipe on specific functionality will yield you different results. My gosh , it lacks keep it simple strategy definitely.
 -Annoying home button on right side, you keep unintentionally touching it when typing a message and it goes to home screen, happens a lot of times with me.
 -Phone Book is not that user friendly to maintain.
 -Its keyboard is very bad in typing; My thinking is if one's feeling with keyboard is not good then feeling with phone can't be nicer.
 
 
 
 Overall, due to less user friendly, this phone will get 6.5/10.

I went into carphone wharehouse to check this awesome looking metal bodied phone out. I decided to buy. but first I got the guy to show me the volume on both mini and standard.
 mini sounded like cats screaming. so it was a no no as I listen to audio books and music while on my gym. 
 I showed me big phone. the sound was good much better than the mini.
 so my friend that was with me was looking at the Lumia 925. I went up to see. I asked guy to let me hear it .
 I have to admit it the nokia had the edge.
 after already using a 920 I felt I wanted a change but.

I think your battery is just fine but try not to leave it in the future that much. It is better to prevent any issues with the battery but i would say that at present will go as normal. Li-ion or li-polimer have some protection to overcharging and overheating and should be ok.
 But if you will go like this for 3-6 months in the row then some damage could result to your phone's battery.

I am a user of htc one. I got it yesterday. Probably the best looking phone i have ever had ( previously i have owned an htc one s, sgs II, htc desire, several nokias,so) and i have ever seen to my friends.
 As for the speed: internet isn't faster than htc one s, but the screen resolution is 4 times greater.
 
 Bads: no zero gaps at top and bottom and there is a slight issue (a line like a scratch, but i think it is because of aluminium treatment, an imperfection)
 
 For those who are thinking that bezels around the screen are too big, fear not. The overall design request this and blends excellents with the overall look of the phone.
 
 The sound and display are amazing. Sound is incredible for a mobile device and screen looks like is painted.
 
 After 2 days i can't give more details. It is charging relatively fast: 2h and 30 min aprox.; I am a user of htc one. I got it yesterday.

Guys, it's a no-brainer. SG4 is the leading smartphones specs wise. They are not perfect but they are superior than other smartphones out there. Now in my opinion, HTC one is the next best thing. And believe it or not, I am going to buy this because the specs are so close to SG4 but with better design, sound and the 4 ultrapixel seems really impressive. So I wont mind the HTCs few drawbacks from SG4 because those features I mentioned are what sold me to HTC one. And I think if HTC one improve a little bit of its camera, the battery and add a slot... even if they maintain the other specs... then god almighty, HTC one will be my Smartphone master!; Guys, it's a no-brainer.

 Yes, when i used it for long (maybe more than 30 min), i can feel the heat especially from the back of the phone..
 
 But i think this is very common and not really an issue.. every running machine produces heat, right? The only difference is, with HTC One, you will feel it more coz the body of the phone was made of aluminium.. When it is hot, just stop for a while whatever you are doing and let it cold down.. thats all.. not a big deal..; I've been using my new HTC One for the past 1 week.. and i like it very much!; Yes, when i used it for long (maybe more than 30 min), i can feel the heat especially from the back of the phone..; But i think this is very common and not really an issue.. every running machine produces heat, right?

Hi All,
 Please please please do not spend so much money on this phone.
 HTC One looks great, feels great and is definitely very fast.. I've used the phone for 2 months.. It ran smoothly for the first 2 months and I was like very very impressed with the phone. Then it all went downhill..
 My phone stopped charging.. And the speaker would always switch on.. whether i made a call or received a call the speaker would automatically switch on. 
 The only way to charge my phone was to switch the phone off and then charge it..
 its weird.. i know .. but suddenly.. the phone started behaving weird..
 
 its hardly 2 months old.. so i had warranty. took it to the authorized service center on the 19th of August. It's been 15 days.. They are unable to service the phone.. They know its a hardware issue but they will not replace the phone.. They have been waiting for spares for the past 15 days. Everyday is a new excuse and a new lie..
 
 I'm sincerely asking you folk to not go by the reviews. A phone that cannot be serviced, a company that does not respect its warranty replacement policy and a service center occupied by what can be referred as nothing but arrogant, obnoxious staff is not something you guys want to pay u're hard earned money on.

 It is.. apps from the Play Store, as well as apps from iTunes and Windows Phone Store, can be always downloaded again (from the same account, of course) once they have been purchased. This means, you can remove apps from your phone to free memory, and download and install them again whenever you want later. 
 Besides, even if phones are provided with an SD card slot, apps can't be moved to SD cards anymore.
 There is one last issue left: some apps are removed from stores by their developers, and are lost forever: this can be avoided by downloading them to a computer, and storing them there (they can be installed only on the phone, not on the computer, at one's wish).
 
 One a more personal side, I'll pick an Xperia ZL because of HTC One productive unreliabily and many bugs and flaws reported by users.

Some times it's never respond and we have to look at the webpage constantly it's hurting your eyes and neck. Just imagine you are reading a web article. You have to only focuses at it without even moving your head and eyeballs, if needed. Just imagine how it's hurt your eyes and even neck when you looking at the phone display around 3min constantly.
 
 So every phone has it own advantages and disadvantages. The drawbacks that you have mentioned regarding HTC One are not serious problems. But if I start to talk about the drawbacks about S4, I can list around 10.
 
 Anyway nice attempts to trolling here, better luck next time.

1- In this phone we can not zoom IN a photo which is downloaded by any source like we can do in other phones and we just can zoom a photo when we turn ON "Magnification gestures" but then we have to tap for tree tym on screen or if we typing any msg and we put backspace continuously , the screen goes zoom IN 
 just a rubbish and irritating this is .
 
 2- When we watch a vdo , there should be a option like SAMSUNG provide while vdo is playing which is you can just click and rotate the screen at that time only which will not apply on whole system but, in this phone, you first need to go to setting and then turn on "auto rotate" 
 huh , very very silly things they missed in this 
 i hope they will update it .; 1- In this phone we can not zoom IN a photo which is downloaded by any source like we can do in other phones and we just can zoom a photo when we turn ON "Magnification gestures" but then we have to tap for tree tym on screen or if we typing any msg and we put backspace continuously , the screen goes zoom IN; just a rubbish and irritating this is .; 2- When we watch a vdo , there should be a option like SAMSUNG provide while vdo is playing which is you can just click and rotate the screen at that time only which will not apply on whole system but, in this phone, you first need to go to setting and then turn on "auto rotate"; huh , very very silly things they missed in this; i hope they will update it .
GSMArena, you forgot to specify that the USB here is an "ON-the-Go" one.. 
 fix it, that's important.
 
 Also.. "audio quality" data is incorrect: clicking on it we are directed to the review and original measurements, which are much better than those put on the phone data page: correct those.; GSMArena, you forgot to specify that the USB here is an "ON-the-Go" one..; fix it, that's important.; Also..

And other things that I like about this phone is the super user friendly and lag free User Interface. Just check the HTC UI with many other high-end Android phones in the market, you will understand it. This phone is utterly lag free, while my friends who using the S4 are complaining that it's lagging frequently. The music quality of this phone is superb, the best music quality no doubt, even better than iphone and Xperia. When comes to the display, its display is excellent, but not the best. According to my experience the Xperia Z has the best display. The HTC One display stand for the second place. However there is not a big difference in those two displays, some times it feels the equal. When comparing the HTC One display with the S4 or iPhone 5 you will feel what a waste of they are. Another great feature is frontal dual speakers, much needed for the Skype video calls and loud speaker calls. Just imagine how annoying it is when the loud speaker placed on back side. The camera is good like I was said earlier, this is the only phone that produces natural looking photos. If you take photo of sky from the S4, the clouds are not visible in photo.
 
 What I can say is this the best Android device in the market right now, don't mislead to the internet articles that mentioned the S4 is the best phone and what they are saying.

1- In this phone we can not zoom IN a photo which is downloaded by any source like we can do in other phones and we just can zoom a photo when we turn ON "Magnification gestures" but then we have to tap for tree tym on screen or if we typing any msg and we put backspace continuously , the screen goes zoom IN 
 just a rubbish and irritating this is .

wahby , 27 Aug 2013Pls who can give details about the camera quality of this phone?, experienced users pls!What I can say about the camera is it's a perfect camera, it's not the best but perfect enough for the high quality day to day photography and fastest shutter speed is much needed for take a immediate shot.
 
 I have experience with the high-end phones like HTC One, S4, Xperia Z and Lumia 925. Among them only the HTC One takes the most natural and realistic pictures. Some times the photos taken from S4, Lumia 925 and Xperia Z doesn't look natural (over saturated). And another advantage of the HTC One is its low lights performance, but it's not much great as Lumia 925. The low light and indoor photos taken from the S4 is horrible. The Wide Angle lens of the HTC One perfect for the landscape photography and you can take a group shot even 10 persons, perfectly fit for the frame. The innovative features are fantastic and very useful, however the S4 has the most features in the HTC One. When comes to the video recording I feel the HTC One is the best for the video recording but Lumia is good in better video stability.
 
 When we talk about drawbacks, lack of zooming of the photos. The pictures taken from the HTC One are lower resolutions (it's not effects the quality of the photos only for the zooming) than many phones in the market. Therefore we can't zoom much in a computer which a photo taken from the HTC One. It's start to blur beyond 3x zoom. The day light photos of the HTC One is arguable. Some are saying they are good and some are complaining they are bad. However what I feel most people evaluate it by looking at the picture colours. HTC One takes more natural photos almost same like looking at your eyes. While S4 and Lumia 925 takes saturated and much vibrant colours. However the new 4.2.2 has increased the vibrant of the photos.
 
 Finally my conclusion is the HTC One camera is a perfect camera don't misleading for the internet articles. But I acknowledge since it has some problems. The every phone you takes has it's own disadvantages. What I feel here is, the new UltraPixel concept of the HTC is a good idea, HTC should keep improve that technology. I hope next time the HTC will design a phone with a 8up camera.; What I can say about the camera is it's a perfect camera, it's not the best but perfect enough for the high quality day to day photography and fastest shutter speed is much needed for take a immediate shot.; I have experience with the high-end phones like HTC One, S4, Xperia Z and Lumia 925. Among them only the HTC One takes the most natural and realistic pictures. Some times the photos taken from S4, Lumia 925 and Xperia Z doesn't look natural (over saturated). And another advantage of the HTC One is its low lights performance, but it's not much great as Lumia 925. The low light and indoor photos taken from the S4 is horrible. The Wide Angle lens of the HTC One perfect for the landscape photography and you can take a group shot even 10 persons, perfectly fit for the frame. The innovative features are fantastic and very useful, however the S4 has the most features in the HTC One. When comes to the video recording I feel the HTC One is the best for the video recording but Lumia is good in better video stability.; When we talk about drawbacks, lack of zooming of the photos. The pictures taken from the HTC One are lower resolutions (it's not effects the quality of the photos only for the zooming) than many phones in the market. Therefore we can't zoom much in a computer which a photo taken from the HTC One. It's start to blur beyond 3x zoom. The day light photos of the HTC One is arguable. Some are saying they are good and some are complaining they are bad. However what I feel most people evaluate it by looking at the picture colours. HTC One takes more natural photos almost same like looking at your eyes. While S4 and Lumia 925 takes saturated and much vibrant colours. However the new 4.2.2 has increased the vibrant of the photos.; Finally my conclusion is the HTC One camera is a perfect camera don't misleading for the internet articles.

There is 6gb allocated for the apps storage and 25gb for the phone memory (for storing music, videos, photos and etc). You can't increase the apps storage space or phone memory spaces. It's already store around 5gb data in the apps storage when you buying the phone; that's for the Android system and 1gb space available for the install downloading apps. 
 
 I already installed 19 apps in the apps storage, they took only 238mb. That's mean you can install around 80 apps in the 1gb apps storage. You know that no-one in the world will install 80 apps in the phone. However if your apps storage get full, no need to worry you can install the apps into the phone memory; in addition you can store your data in a usb storage either, if the whole 32gb memory got full. I'm using the 32gb version, although if you afraid that the 32gb memory space is not sufficient, there is 64gb version available either.

That's why most phones these days comes with lack of a sd card slot and at the same time increasing the memory space. I know the next iPhone's memory space has been increased up to 128gb. The real question here is since why Apple didn't add it a sd card slot instead of the increasing memory. Do you still need a sd card slot even though a phone came with a 128gb memory space???????
 
 If you really need a phone with a sd card slot just buy a phone which comes with a sd card slot rather than whining here like a kid by telling "this phone hasn't a sd card slot", even that's will save your time and others.; First of all I'm not getting paid from HTC for promoting HTC One, I'm a truly satisfied the HTC One user. May I ask you, how much do you get paid for bashing towards HTC One.; I didn't disgraced any nationality here. Don't start a nationality war here. Do understand what are the things we should and shouldn't store in a phone? A phone is for store only important things (even music and videos up to manageable amount) that we need in day to day life. What I feel here is may be you are storing every stuff that wanted and unwanted in the phone.

 S4 is about numbers and benchmarks it sweeps htc one in benchmarks by a lot. however, phone gets really hot when in pocket and charging and i dont know why.

Hey guys just wanted an advice from those of you who have a lot of knowledge on Android Powered Smartphones.
 
 Firstly, what would be a better option, the Samsung Galaxy S4 or the HTC One?
 
 And why is which phone better. Please tell me cons about each phone and which one should I go for.
 
 I would really appreciate your help :)

HTC ONE: Observations after 1 month of use
 
 HTC one ,the flagship device of HTC for the year 2013 has won accolades all over the world for its brilliant design and performance.But in today's competetive world, choosing the best device from the hundreds available in the market is some task.I was in a similar fix a month back when I was scratching my head off to reach a conclusion on which device should i opt for. After a series of specification comparisons, hands down experiences I finally decided to go ahead with the HTC one.Today, after exactly one month of usage here are some of the observations that I have drawn from day to day use.
 
 Design
 Among all the flagship smartfones launched this year by different companies,HTC one by large was the best in design and build quality.The first time I touched it felt like heaven.The coldness of aluminium u feel when u touch it is something u cannot explain in words ,it's simply exceptional.For many years the success of apple's iphone was largely based on the brilliant design and build quality of their devices.Android devices simply didn't have that feel and design to match apple's brilliance . But the HTC one this year , seems to have taken the challenge to apple and no doubt it is the best design android smartfone ever made. The HTC one feels like a premium smartfone,has an excellent build quality, looks stunning and gives u the value for your money.
 
 Operating system/User Interface
 HTC one comes with android 4.1.2 out of the box having its own sense interface.The thing to note here is that the previous sense versions were quite heavy and seemed to lag a bit on heavy usage . But this time around HTC seems to have learnt their lesson from past experiences and come out with a completely new version of sense 5. The newest version of sense is not only lighter than the previous sense versions but is also a lot faster . It perform's daily tasks with almost no lag whatsoever.In addition HTC also has the new Blinkfeed feature which I myself find useful as it provides u with news , updates on the go.However there are some around who dont like the feature much and complain that there is no option to disable it.But giving due credit to the HTC team , they seem to have done an excellent job on the new sense version this year.The sense 5 is lag less and runs like a charm.
 
 Screen
 There are many reviewers out there who compare by saying that the galaxy s4 has 441 ppi while the HTC one has 468 ppi largely due to the fact that the ONE is 0.3 inches smaller.But from a layman's perspective I feel there is no difference that one may notice between the two devices screen with a naked eye.However,I must also add that the screen on the HTC gives more natural colors and is a bit more realistic.It doesn't saturate the colors and displays them the way they appear in real or the way they are captured.To conclude this in one line,screen on the HTC one is simply outstanding.
 
 Camera
 This is a bit of a dissapointment. When an individual shells out around 44000 bucks for a device, he expects it to simply be the best all around. Though HTC claims that they have come up with an altogether new ULTRAPIXEL technology on this device and the pixels don't really matter for a camera to capture good,crisp photos the truth is far from this.In broad day-light the HTC captures good photos but not as brilliant as some other devices available in the market.However in low light conditions HTC holds an edge over other smartfones as it captures photos effortlessly. It also has a new ZOE feature the HTC has introduced,that allows you to capture a moving photo of 3 seconds.The main problem with the HTC starts when the photo's captured loose their crispness and sharpness even when u zoom in a little.The photo's appear good with natural colors when captured but begin to loose their sharpness once you try to zoom in on a particular detail.All in all, the camera on HTC one is not the best and barely manages to compete with other smartfone camera's out there.
 
 Battery
 The battery on this device is a bit dissapointing . Although all the smartfones available around have the same problem of battery life , HTC one is no exception. It has its own share of battery related issues. On average usage of 1 hour calls , 1 hour music , games , watsapp , facebook and internet ,the battery would last for around 12-14 hours.The major factor that sucks the battery is the sense 5 . I expect HTC to provide a fix for this in future updates(currently I am running on android 4.2.2).
 
 Storage
 The HTC one come's with a 32 gig and a 64 gig storage capacity with no expandable memory slot.I own a 32 gig model which provides me with 25 gigs of available storage capacity.As far as my usage is concerned ,I find this enough for me but then again it depends on personal choice and requirements.
 
 Music and sound
 The boomspeakers on the front are exceptional and play crisp and clear music .However one thing that I found annoying was the fact that when i turned on the beats audio option in settings the sound coming from the speakers seemed to burst a little when played on full volume.There was no problem what so ever when I turned off beats audio setting.Overall the sound is crisp,clear and loud .
 
 Verdict
 HTC one is no doubt one of the best smartfones i have ever owned (I have previously owned an HTC wildfire S,iphone 4 and the galaxy s3).Although i must say that I myself didn't have any complain with the galaxy s3 that i owned for a year, but one thing I came across while using HTC one is that it is noticably fast as compared to galaxy s3. All in all I am happy and satisfied with my choice of investing money on this device after one month of usage; HTC ONE: Observations after 1 month of use; HTC one ,the flagship device of HTC for the year 2013 has won accolades all over the world for its brilliant design and performance.But in today's competetive world, choosing the best device from the hundreds available in the market is some task.I was in a similar fix a month back when I was scratching my head off to reach a conclusion on which device should i opt for.

The HTC One is one of the best Android handsets in the US right now. Its big rival is the Samsung Galaxy S4, which recently got a shot in the arm from an OTA update that removed the lags its had been suffering from.
 
 What’s the HTC One got going for it? Will it have Android 5.0 (Key Lime Pie), as this OS is supposed to be coming out this year. However, Android 4.3 has been creating quite a stir, and apparently the HTC One will be the only HTC Android phone to get this update.
 
 Recently we got an interesting tip from an HTC source who’s been on the money about HTC phones before.
 
 This source said that the Jelly Bean 4.3 update has already been submitted to the four big US carriers – weeks before the HTC One was bumped up to Android 4.2. It seems, then, that AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile have had the 4.3 update for testing out for some time!
 
 This must mean that the T-Mobile HTC one could be in line for the JB 4.3 update in August or September. We also wouldn’t be surprised if Spring and AT&T bring it out this summer as well.
 
 We also need to talk about the upcoming Verizon HTC One. If Verizon actually does have the 4.3 update for review and approval, this may mean two things. There might be a Verizon HTC One on the way pretty quick! And – it might come with Jelly Bean 4.3 pre-installed.
 
 All this is just smoke and mirrors at the moment, so don’t take this info as gospel. We’ll let you know more as soon as we find out more.; The HTC One is one of the best Android handsets in the US right now.

 HTC One comes with the Wide Angle lens ideal for the landscape photography and another advantage is we can take a group photo of even 10 persons, perfectly fit to the frame while S4 can't because of its narrow field lens.; In the low-lights and indoor conditions HTC One is clearly the winner.

I am using the HTC One for two months. two observations. the camera is a real down side. the low light performance is also not up to the mark in comparison to the S4.i dropped it once, and it got an ugly dent on the top right corner. so guys use a protective case. battery is average but its ok for me. but i am really unhappy with the camera performance. HTC could have gone with the traditional 13MP camera. they brought something new on the table but its not good enough, at least not for a flagship.; I am using the HTC One for two months. two observations. the camera is a real down side. the low light performance is also not up to the mark in comparison to the S4.i dropped it once, and it got an ugly dent on the top right corner. so guys use a protective case. battery is average but its ok for me. but i am really unhappy with the camera performance.

The HTC One is by far the best Handset that HTC have released to date. 
 Previously having an Iphone5 and a Samsung Galaxy S3, I found that the Iphone you couldn't personalise the handset
 and the Samsung Galaxy S3 often froze.
 The HTC Ones camera is amazing, although lags when is on 'flash mode' 
 I find the handset is a great design. screen with the constant feed is great, 
 and the extra features turning your phone in to a remote is awesome! 
 You can also change the background of the text messaging to a photo.

No doubt HTC ONE is one of the best htc has ever made. Htc makes good software mostly bug free, lag free than its competitors. But where htc lags behind is when updating their flagship phones with latest android. However we all know that htc has just released 4.2 2 to htc one. But regarding my personal experience with htc I can bet u that in coming months whenever Google announce its next android i.e key lime pie, either htc in future will going to cancel it or may take ages to update. Am not a htc hater, but its just a feedback from myself to help htc do better. Even SONY is being so much aggressive with their updates so why htc lags behind? ? I hope htc should learn from SONY.; No doubt HTC ONE is one of the best htc has ever made. Htc makes good software mostly bug free, lag free than its competitors.

 1 Turn on mobile data.
 2 Go to the settings.
 3 Choose Mobile Data.
 4 Tap Network Mode.
 5 Then select GSM/WCDMA Auto.
 
 The mobile data speed and connectivity depend on according to your service provider. If your mobile network 3g signals and speed are low, then nothing to do with the phone.

I've been using this phone for almost a month now (moved on from a galaxy s3) and I've really come to like it. The only two drawbacks that I can think of are:
 1)The camera quality isn't that great (In my opinion the s3 camera was far better)
 2)The phone heats up more then often (especially while playing games), and I've noticed sometimes when I put it on charge and leave the phone on my bed, it tends to heat up A LOT

 Its impossible that htc is totally neglecting the fact that they do need to advertise.

bought HTC One Glamour Red last week & only issue is that is that metal body is heating up comparing to other form factors but Supreme Design & Quality even the Hardware Spec.
 Ultrapixel Camera & its capabilities are being effectively used by HTC Zoe app. no matter how awesomely faster shutter speed or Pixel or Aperture u can get from a SmartPhone but no App on android nor iOS can do the things what HTC Zoe can do !!!!

Just bought the HTC One. Fantastic. Just feelds like a quality piece of kit, fantastic build quality, gorgeous screen, fast and smooth operating system. Love it.

I used Htc One X and GSIII at the same time as I use two cell phones. Got bored on my s3 but I loved it due to its battery life and simplicity. Yeah. Htc is fun but One X's battery life was crap. Few days ago I went to buy GS4 and I came home with HTC one. I could resist the beauty of this device. It simply knocked out the S4. And yeah HTC has improved the battery life pretty well. Its really good and it will survive a day of heavy usage. Btw, s4 has better battery life than htc one. But those who are pretty tensed about the battery life I have some questions to them.
 1. Don't you have electricity?
 2. If you play games all the day then shouldn't you buy a PSP? 
 Btw camera is good. Most of the people who complain about megapixels. What will you do with a large picture. I dont think you guys use these pictures anywhere excpet facebook or social sites ! I guess when you are jealous you will always try to find a negative point ! Anyways. I love my htc one and I also use a samsung s3. Honestly , the one is really the number one right now ! Oh..

Ok, so I'm using my htc one for over a week now. I really wanted to get this phone from day one, and I'm not dissappointed. It delivered my expectations and I think there is no direct competitor to this atm, regarding overall quality.
 The only things that could be added is the micro sd slot and a bit bigger battery, but it's not that big of a concern for me, since I'm used to charge my phones every night anyways. Other than that, this phone is flawless. The screen is the best I've seen on a phone, incredibly sharp and bright. Sound is the best as well, loudspeakers and headset sound very crisp and crystal clear. Also there are visualisations, lyrics and stuff included. I don't use camera that much, but I noticed it has a very quick and accurate focus, good color reproduction most of the time, and a ton of features. I really like the face adjustment kit, you can make changes to the skin, eyes, etc with one click and it works really well. Gaming experience is awesome, but I noticed it heats up quite a bit when playing HD games, so it drains battery quite fast. Reception, call quality, messaging - no complaints. Build quality is miles ahead from other smartphones, except the iPhone - they both feel as classy in hand. Not planning to use any case on this beauty, don't have any scratches yet. Got the 4.2.2

The camera is excellent. I got a HTC ONE recently. Yes it is only 4mp but if you do research you will see they call it a "Ultra Pixel". Basically its less mega pixels but the camera lens is a lot bigger which gives you a better image quality. You cant zoom in much but normal shots look really good especially at night.; The camera is excellent. I got a HTC ONE recently.

After two weeks with my htc one I can say this phone is really great and the best I have had.
 
 What I really liked:
 
 -The build quality is just phenomenal and the best I have ever seen in a mobile phone. It's even better than the iPhone 5 because it feels more sturdy and it sits very well in the hand in spite of it's size. At first I was worried I might drop it but then I realized it provides a good grip. I can't describe how neat and premium it is you just have to try it.
 -The user interface and responsiveness. I used a Samsung before this and the first difference I noticed HTC has gone for simplicity rather than features. I liked how neat and stylish sense 5 it does not look cartoonish like touch-wiz but I guess it is not as effective as the galaxy. Not that I miss any of touch-wiz features now, I can certainly live without them. What I really like and matters the most is the HTC one is responsive and speedy there is no lag at all. Menus appear instantly as you touch the screen and apps open really quick too.
 -The screen and boom sound. They collectively make for a good multimedia experience. The screen is very sharp and vibrant and it is not bad under the sun either. But the S4 screen slightly produces better colors or saturation.
 Well I bet everyone knows the boom-sound is the best among all phones. I compared it to my brother's galaxy s4 and they nearly have the same loudness with beats audio turned on, but when you turn it off there is a boost in it's loudness. Off course I had to turn the S4 to face it's back when I compared them so you see the placement of the stereo speakers at the front of the htc one really makes a big difference. By the way beats audio does a very good job and I keep it turned on.
 
 What I disliked:
 
 -no memory card. 25 gb of user available memory space means I can't put in many HD movies and videos.
 -blink feed can not be removed
 
 Now the tings I haven't mentioned before because they were just OK for me:
 
 -Battery life. It lasted a full day (16 hours) with moderate use like texting, music, a little bit of non HD gaming,a lot of internet browsing and navigation. It is not extraordinary and not bad at the same time.
 -I don't use the camera that much but I can say it is really good and fast too. The only complaint is at 4 megapixels you can't capture many details, so far away objects and landscape scenery is not good on this phone. But for everyday scenarios it is more than capable. And it's really good at low light pictures.
 -The non removable battery is not an issue for me since I don't swap batteries and have never changed one before. But if your battery dies (probability of occurrence = 10%-30%) then you will have to send it to htc for replacement and where I live there is no htc center.
 
 conclusion: If you don't get the HTC one then you are missing a one in a decade phone. It is just too much quality in a single phone. If you combine a better build quality than the iphone, a speedy user interface like iOS, a versatile OS like android, top specifications like Samsung and innovation then you get the htc one.

The phone model, build quality, screen is awesome. But rest everything is a big minus for me and I have returned it. 
 1. Was unable to play music on my car stereo (Sienna) AUX port while connected to its audio out port.
 2. Was unable to transfer photos and videos from the phone to Laptop. Could not detect the phone in my Windows 7 HP Laptop using USB cable. 
 3. WiFi can turn-on automatically even if you disable it.
 4. The touch screen though good, was not perfect like apple. I have experienced lot of typos while using whatsup app and twitter.
 5. The screen-unlock key and emergency-call keys are next to each other and I hit emergency-call key once by mistake and called 911.
 6. The "back" button does not work in single touch, had to hit twice on many occasions.
 7. No separate menu to sort voice mails and no option to selectively delete a voice mail.
 8. When you try to close the browser in single touch, wont work.Need to hit X mark using thumb and hold for some what longer to close the browser.
 9. Sound quality not as good as iphone. Try to Play songs and you will feel it.; The phone model, build quality, screen is awesome.

After reading amazinf reviews online, I finally bought this phone. Before this I owned a HTC Desire Z, which was an amazing phone too and why I decided to stick to HTC. It has been 3 days, and I'm actually struggling to like this phone. No doubt this is a light, good looking and faster handset. But there are many internal interface issues that I do not recommend. Its not as easy to get things done, and not as intuitive as it was for my Desire Z. You even wont find obvious buttons like 'Save' after you made some changes on Settings. There are no shortcuts to your last accessed apps, you have to return to home to open it again.It has great processor and OS on board, but they have screwed up the simplicity of interaction.

 Speed : HTC One is speeder that S4 even though S4 has a higher processor (Lol). Check this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZvcdM3TZnc 
 
 Display : HTC one is way better than S4 display, giving you much more vibrant and realistic colours. Check this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlK0hGfTY4E 
 
 Music : HTC One is the best phone for music lovers, no doubt about it. And S4 stock headphones are vibrating when you increased the volume. It's a wonderful example of the S4 build quality (XD).
 
 The Front dual speakers gives you rich audio output rather than a back side speaker, which is very annoying. It's very helpful for the loudspeaker calls, even the Skype video chatting.
 
 Camera : HTC One allow you to tack a perfect photo in the day light as well as the low light, which S4 can't take a perfect photo in the low light.
 
 HDR microphones allows you to take a excellent clarity call even noisy environment. 
 
 32 GB of memory for the same price as 16 GB on the S4.
 
 FM transmitter.
 
 Car mode (turns Bluetooth on, car-convenient UI).
 
 Sense 5 is a more user friendly and lag free UI than lagging Touchwiz. 
 
 Premium looking metal body rather than the cheap looking plastic S4.
 
 Now can you understand those higher specifications and gestures would not give a perfect phone. HTC One is the best example.; Let's forget those technical & specification terms for a moment.

Hope there is also waterproof smart watch camera phone from HTC like what LG did last 2010. Sony made a bluetooth watch where you need your real smart phone within your range but its not as good as what LG did where you can insert a different sim card to ensure to receive all important calls and messages as well as instantly sending messages and making calls. Its a very useful device for active people who spend their day most on sports like swimming running dancing and other physical activities which I do not understand why only less cellphone manufacturers follow LG with this concept.; Hope there is also waterproof smart watch camera phone from HTC like what LG did last 2010.

MohammedNestle, 19 Jul 2013I have a iPhone 5 now that is excellent but I like change and I want to buy htc one Do you advise meDepends on what kind of apple fan are u. If ur a die hard apple fan that has his mind closed on other things then u wont be happy with the one. I personally dont buy apple because of microsd slot and file transfers over pc. Itunes doesnt recognize a lot of formats which u have to do a lot of converting first. I do like watching movies in my phone so thats a deal breaker. I wont buy the stupid things other people r saying about cloud. Transfering via sd slot is still much easier. Htc phones r very good, my htc desire is still with me without and problems and how long has it been released. I gave it to my mom and bought xe. sold Xe to try s3 but wasnt happy then now bought the butterfly. Im really happy with htc. Never failed me.; Depends on what kind of apple fan are u.

I usually never had the urge to give an opinion / review of a smartphone but for the HTC One, I just felt I had to because this phone is more than I ever expected before.. 
 
 I had this phone for about 2 months and until now I have no complaints whatsoever on this phones, yes it's not a perfect phone but still it delivers the best experience of a smartphone in my opinion.
 
 I really love how Zoe, its Live Gallery and its Video Highlights compliment each other and gives me a whole different experience of enjoying moments that I have captured.
 
 The dual front speaker? -- I'm amazed, this simple thing makes a huge differences on how I enjoy media in my phone..
 
 Those two features alone could have made me fascinated with the HTC One.. But the thing is this phone still have so much more to offer! Blinkfeed is beautiful and I love it being as my main home screen, I even restrain myself from using a launcher because I still want Blinkfeed in my home screen.. Also SenseTV, it's actually a simple feature, but again, I found myself checking and setting up a reminder of my favorite show on my phone rather than using the original EPG option.. It's just so much simpler.. 
 
 I could go on and on about things that I love on my HTC One.. But believe me, you just have to try it yourself.

The HTC One is a feature rich device that gets a lot right from the start
 Industrial Design: Metal Unibody, light & slim profile which really feels like the premium product that it is.
 
 Dual front facing Boomsound speakers with Beats Audio really was a revelation to me. It makes listening to music direct from the phone a joy; its clear and isn't lacking in power which was totally unexpected when I first heard it.So much for thinking it was just a marketing gimmick!
 
 Blinkfeed is a good new & Social media aggregator, and the Full HD screen makes watching videos a joy, and reading text a breeze. Using the latest Sense software is a lag-free experience thanks to the Quad-core processor, 2GB Ram and good integration done.
 
 The Ultrapixel camera excels in low light and in the right hands, performs quite well in almost all other situations as well. Yes, it can overexpose if you're not careful, but that can be worked around with proper click to focus use, which also adjusts the exposure accordingly. But more importantly, is HTC Zoe & Video Highlights. Would you miss the resolution in some cases, perhaps. But this camera is more than capable of meeting 90 of a typical users' needs.
 
 One feature that isn't too talked about is the optical stabilisation which benefits both photo taking & video. The ability to shoot at 60 FPS, slow motion mode, and also Full HDR video which would be interesting for those who're so creatively inclined.
 
 The IR-blaster was something else that I wasn't sure about at first. Gimmicky? in some ways, yes, but with Sense TV, you do have a Smart Remote with TV guide in your phone now. Found it useful at home and in public areas when testing its usage and range (decent line-of-sight range on it!)

Fantastic phone, had for 2 weeks, its been amazing, better than the s4, it is faster even though it has a lower clock speed, it just is snappier, blinkfeed isnt useless, i find myself using it when i'm bored, the only problem is that you can only have 4 home screens and the it overheats, it gets to 42 degress c! an improvement would be making the dock transparent. The 4 megapixel camera is great but only badly notice-able when you zoom in other than the slight quality issue colours are great and low light performance is amazing! this phone gets an 8.75/10!; Fantastic phone, had for 2 weeks, its been amazing, better than the s4, it is faster even though it has a lower clock speed, it just is snappier, blinkfeed isnt useless, i find myself using it when i'm bored, the only problem is that you can only have 4 home screens and the it overheats, it gets to 42 degress c! an improvement would be making the dock transparent.
