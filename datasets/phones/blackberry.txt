Good News:
 I've found the real problem Regarding
 to Your blackberry 9320 re-booting and battery draining very fast. I was facing
 the same problem for the past 4
 months. It seems that there is a
 design fault in the battery case
 of the 9320. The battery does
 not fit in properly and as result it
 gets short and results in battery
 drainage and re-booting. I used a
 very simple way to counter this
 problem. You can try this too
 and share your experience with
 me on my mail shez55@mail.com
 Now here Is a solution:
 Get a small piece of paper may
 2inches X 2 inches. Fold it into
 half. Remove your BB 9320
 battery and place half of the
 folded paper below the end of
 the battery such that the other
 half wrpas around it and comes
 on top of it. Now force place the
 battery into the battery
 compartment and if needed add
 more paper. The battery should
 fit in tight. Close the phone case
 and Bingo...Congratulations You Just Got Saved Yourself From Headache And Stress Regarding Your BlackBerry Smartphone! Good Luck Enjoy; Good News:

I have used Blackberry mobiles for the last five years. 
 I am currently using the BB Curve 9320. Like my previoes two models (Curve 9300 and Curve 8520), I enjoyed using the 9320.
 But for the last four months, I have had nothing but problems with it. This is because it has kept rebooting itself randomly, which has drained the battery within hours of been fully charged.
 Blackberry could have have been a serious contender, against the likes of it's competitors, with apps and touchscreen features, which previously did not interest me at all. I was a happy Blackberry user.
 The stuation with the rebooting and drained battery was the point of no return for me with Blackberry. I contacted Blackberry to tell them about my concerns, but they just put me through to my service provider, 'burying their head in the sand' and not listening to it's users.; I have used Blackberry mobiles for the last five years.

I have used this Phone for now 4months and I have seen a lot of things that need correction among others are:
 
 1. Battery my battery keeps on telling me battery too low for radio use besides being full.
 2. 3G an this phone causes overheating of the phone and drains battery.
 3. When I insert original headsets it witches to voice calling
 4. Most apps are for sale very few apps are free when the majority of the people in developing countries DO NOT have CREDIT card to buy apps. Introduce other methods of buying apps e.g by making a specific crutch card that could contain a purchasing code and this card is to be sold like scratch cards for talk time.
 5. Introduce more third party music player because only what I saw from app word is baamboo player.
 6. Applications need regular update,you find that the Phone was Introduced in 2012 most apps are 2010.
 7. Battery capacity needs to be revisited let's say 1450mAh to 2650mAh+
 8. I'm unable to download most game from waptrick.com but with blackberry os 5 I was able to download ultimate mortal combart for free. But with this very handset it keeps on saying subscribe to BlackBerry zone and when I try open a pop up, it BB Zone is not available from your country.

Pity they are no longer made as my contract about to run out and will be looking for new phone - would have How can i conect my phone internet to computer I've been facing immense problem with its battery since Aug '14. Sometimes battery shows to be fully drained as such needs replacement ,frequently fone shows general error in supplementary service mode. Besides Ranchi, there is no service center in Jharkhand state. Fone very often trips on pressing any fn. key, be it in calling or idle mode, without warning. My set is two to three yrs old . It has become totally unreliable Hi, please is there anyway I can upgrade the old Facebook version to android version ? Really,I just got the phone and it actually brought back my old list of friends and likes. Also, I can't download instagram from blackberry world. I'll so much appreciate if there is something I can do. I'll be expecting a response soon. Thanks I have had my Blackberry phone for a year and a half and I love it. I can't recommend it highly enough! It is the best Cell phone I have had. 
 
 I am still using the battery that came with it, even though I bought an extra one right after I purchased this phone. 
 
 It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that other brands have, but I don't need all those things either. 
 
 This phone is very reliable. I listen to audiobooks every day. 
 
 You can feel confident in purchasing a Blackberry phone. I am very happy with mine!

I have had this phone last two years on contract - everything works perfect - charging up by USB perfect - most of all I like it because its small in size so easy to put in pocket - its perfect for music with stacks of space on SD card, easy to download apps for news and other websites, great bluetooth facility nd connects to my home wireless network. I keep in touch on facebook all time via the app and also good app for youtube. There is great typing prediction setting which makes writing so easy its unreal. Pity they are no longer made as my contract about to run out and will be looking for new phone - would have preferred another new one; I have had this phone last two years on contract - everything works perfect - charging up by USB perfect - most of all I like it because its small in size so easy to put in pocket - its perfect for music with stacks of space on SD card, easy to download apps for news and other websites, great bluetooth facility nd connects to my home wireless network.

BB was famous for it query and should maintain that too. Good that they are bringing a new one but looking at the price it looks very high. In India anything in the range of 10-15K is good. More than that people will start thinking and those who start thinking they get better options for 7K to 70K.

Bought it last year December and I have to be very honest when I say that this is the first mobile phone I ever paid for myself as a Christmas box and the only joy I got from it was downloading and upgrading tons of apps and software updates just to improve its performance. Memory cards don't last very long, permanent network coverage problems, media apps crash,the camera gave in, 60% of appworld downloads is not compatible for this model AND l lost 4gig's worth of documents & photos that meant a lot to me. Non-replacable items that only exist in my memory now, well quarter of it..
 For the little amount I spend to activate the BIS each month, it's not even worth it.

Unfortunately Blackberry seems not to be interested anymore in OS 7 except in their last OS 10 - without BIS, data compression and like eating MB with bread as Androids! No updates and even in forums unresponsive for older phones.If this is a way to make advertisment only for the last products, I prefer to switch definitely to the real Android!

Hi,
 
 There I am using this bb 9320 it's a very very helpfull for me,
 Very fast internet speed,using many apps one time camera is decent also in night,sound is mindblowing,

All bb curve phones are problematic being that's bb curve phones are economic class..they are all kindof cheap...so whether u like it or not, it can't definately be perfect..they are low budget in the blackberry world...I sugest u get any bb bold series to get the best out of blackberry. Or any of d z or q series. Bb bold phones are d.

The 1st one I received had a few problems but the one T-Mobile sent to replace it works great.
I have the T-Mobile 9315 which is the same as the 9320. I have had this phone for 3 months and overall am satisfied with it. 
 
 PROs:
 
 The call/voice quality is good and the graphics are better than I expected for such a small display screen. 
 
 Audio quality for media files is acceptable and good enough to use for certain performances. (NOTE: I have used this phone as an MP3 player and connected the headphone output directly to a stereo input of a professional PA system and played background tracks to support live performances.)
 
 Wifi and bluetooth functions are easy to set up and the browser functions are solid enough.
 
 CONs:
 
 The camera will only zoom to 1.8x.
 No Java means some internet media will not play but most net media plays fine.
 One bluetooth device I have sometimes requires redoing the pairing setup before it stays connected. What happens is that only 2 of the 3 functions of the device connects, the status shows the device is conneected then the device disconnects with the "Pairing Failed" error message is heard. This happens about half the time.
 
 OVERALL:
 
 A good phone that is easy to use with good quality for the price. Adding a 32GB media card makes it even better. On a scale of 1 to 10 I rate it as an 8 to 8.5.; I have the T-Mobile 9315 which is the same as the 9320. I have had this phone for 3 months and overall am satisfied with it.
hi my name is nour el din mamdouh mahrous abdel all el sayed i have got a black berry curve 9320 but i like it and my big brother who tell me if i use a wi_fi network out site of my home and i use it anywhere my credite there is no credit for wi-fi network; hi my name is nour el din mamdouh mahrous abdel all el sayed i have got a black berry curve 9320 but i like it and my big brother who tell me if i use a wi_fi network out site of my home and i use it anywhere my credite there is no credit for wi-fi network
I have the 9315 but it is virtually the same as the 9320. I upgraded from the 8820 and the difference is like night and day. Everything about this phone is great with the the only drawbacks being:
 1 - There are some internet media files that will not play but those are rare.
 2 - The camera only zooms to 1.8x.
 3 - The bluetooth will not consistently connect with my car's bluetooth and sometimes requires me to go through the pairing process again. Other bluetooth devices do not have this issue so I think it is an issue in my KIA's bluetooth.
 
 Overall I would give this phone a rating of 4 out of 5.; I have the 9315 but it is virtually the same as the 9320. I upgraded from the 8820 and the difference is like night and day. Everything about this phone is great with the the only drawbacks being:

Hahaha, really smart phone. Just discovered, it knows if the surrounding is bright. If it's dark it opens the keypad's backlight and not if it's bright. Try this in a bright room by covering the LED indicator by your thumb after all the phone's lights get off (idle mode). Then press any key you'll see the keypad's backlight is lighted. Now make the phone idle again and wait for all the phone's lights get off. This time don't cover the LED indicator and press any key, you'll see the keypad's backlight is not lighted because the room has enough light for the user to see the keypad. =); Hahaha, really smart phone.

Superb smart phone. First time to have blackberry phone and it is awesome. I have no problem whatsoever like others are experiencing. Good camera. Threaded SMS. Has radio. I love the music player too, plenty of playing options that are not in many other phones, you slide the CD picture to play the next or previous songs, nice animation, with equalizer i like bass boost in the selection. Good sound quality speaker and headset. Plenty of LED notification color, red for texts/emails/chats, blue for bluetooth, and sometimes rainbow i forgot where. And many more to mention. BlackBerry OS 7 is excellent. ^_^; Superb smart phone. First time to have blackberry phone and it is awesome. I have no problem whatsoever like others are experiencing. Good camera. Threaded SMS.

I would not recommend this phone. Ive had the phone for nearly two years and it hardly works, wasting my contract. I cant do anything without the phone turning itself off. Then, when the phone turns off, it takes about 5-10 mins to reboot. Making important calls is impossible as it will just switch off - it cant even manage what a phone is supposed to do. The battery life is short as well, and the phone will flash an irritating yellow light when the battery is low - why do we need this annoying flashing LED qbove the screen? I had to stick white sticker over it to stop it from being as bright. And if it doesnt turn itself off it will keep freezing.; I would not recommend this phone.

Being a big fan of BB, I purchased a BB curve 9320 few months ago. Initially performance has been upto the mark except some battery back up issues but later it started creating hell lot of issues-while using the phone it will get re-started/switched off frequently. Many a times while talking to somebody it will stop working automatically which will lead to mis-understanding between you and the person at the other end. Handset got serviced three times under warranty period but the issue has not been fixed and more embracing is even after replacing the battery also problem remains the same. Planning for one more round of service. During my first visit to redington service center guy in B'lore demanded Rs200/- for data back up service,but no data has been got stored in memory device.Second time the service guy advised to change the battery from the basement shop run by the service center guy. Rs 2300/- has been charged for a battery replacement and problem still exist as it is...good luck to BB

In my personal opinion, the Blackberry Curve 9320 is a lovely device.
 
 It is simple to use which is its main attribute which for the not so tech savy such as myself it an absolute god send.
 
 The Blackberry Curve 9320 has an awesome qwerty keyboard and no touch screen which makes keeping in contact easy and without the concern of pressing something unwanted by mistake.
 
 Lastly, it comes in a range of bright colors so you can choose one to express your individual style.
 
 All in all, I think its a worthwhile, inexpensive device that suits me just fine and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap and cheerful, easy to use smart phone.; In my personal opinion, the Blackberry Curve 9320 is a lovely device.

Are you sick and tired just because your blackberry battery drain too fast?well don't be!
 Blackberry its designed to work on 3G network for its internet service so using 2G to saver battery life its not an option.
 What drains your battery too fast is your sd card/memory card! You can prove that by removing your sd card/Memory card from your blackberry.but why your memories its affecting your blackberry?because of to much load,what load E.g 1) if you are using 4G memory card make sure you've got at least above 1G free space avaliable. 2)avoid creating music folder like RnB,where the is more than 50 or 100 tracks. That's too much for blackberry 9320 smart phone it is going heat up and drain your battery fast,So let your music folders goes like Rnb > Celine Dion 15 tracks > Chris brown 20 tracks > Bruno mars 10 track and act as much as you want but leave at least above 1G free space! Now you battery can last 1 and half days or 1 day if you are a heaver user! I hope that was helpful; Are you sick and tired just because your blackberry battery drain too fast?well don't be!
Boro , 20 Sep 2013I just bought curve 9320 newly, I want to know how strong is the battery... The battery life sucks. It drains out very quickly in 3-4 hrs after full charging! I tried many things to keep it live and the most effective thing is to switch off 3G and run on 2G. This dramatically improved battery life by 3 times so it lasts up to 12 hrs with normal usage. I posted a useful link below it may help you. Last thing, monitor the top CPU app usage as there might be a specific app running in background that drain the battery.

A soft reset is a three-key combination that resets the BlackBerry smartphone without removing the battery. As mentioned previously, it is only available on BlackBerry smartphone models with a QWERTY keyboard, such as the BlackBerry Bold 9900 smartphone or BlackBerry Torch 9810 smartphone.
 
 To perform a soft reset, complete the following steps.
 
 Press and hold the Alt key (1)
 While holding down the Alt key, press and hold the Right Shift key (2)
 With both of those buttons still pressed, press the Backspace/Delete key (3)
 When the screen turns off to indicate that the BlackBerry smartphone is restarting, you can then release the keys you have been holding.
 
 
 A few more things you should know about the reset process:
 
 Performing a reset does not remove any data
 To fully remove data from a BlackBerry smartphone, you will need to perform a security wipe. To learn more, check out our post on What is a Security Wipe and when should I use it?
 Performing a reset does not remove an IT Policy if one exists. To learn how to do so, check out KB14202 � How to remove an IT policy from a BlackBerry smartphone which can be found in the BlackBerry Technical Solution Center.; A soft reset is a three-key combination that resets the BlackBerry smartphone without removing the battery.

BB 9320/9220 both are children of one parent & are the worst options to buy in a BB. Never buy these phones as after a few months they will start automatically re-boot, when you will be attending an important call you will find your phone was switched off since last 2 minutes.
 Some of the times you may get into a serious problem & service centers are added thief by research in motion, they will keep you waiting for 2 hours & will ask you to wait again as they have lunch time, at last if you can meet those VIP�s they will keep your phone without giving you a standby (as they just don�t have it).. you have to understand this &#61514;
 And what you will see after getting phone serviced (5-6 days) , your all data has been wiped (yes they inform you prior doing this) but the problem of reboot will persist.
 What they can do is Software up gradation & don�t know anything else about repair & maintenance.
 If you want you can get this done 10 times, and they call it as Blackberry service team and their work.

This phone has very good battery life for a phone in its price range but not the best features. This phone managed to survive getting dropped in the sink with the only damage being that pages were a bit slower to load than normal. I did hastily dry it though. However if you drop this it seems more likely to break and break quickly as the exterior body is fully plastic and the plastic feels pretty flimsy.; This phone has very good battery life for a phone in its price range but not the best features.

Well I love my blackberry curve 9320 I have had it for about 6 months now and its a really good phone. It has bluetooth,wi-fi,3.2 mp,2.4" inch screen and a new bbm hotkey on the left side of the device so you can click on it to go onto bbm quickly. The app store is great it keeps the blackberry nice and fun. The downside of this blackberry curve 9320 is that it always freezes and sometimes it freezes for over 10mins so you have to take the battery out of your phone and restart it which takes ages. So overall its a really good smartphone for the price of �140 when I got it for christmas but its gone down in price now for about �120 if you get it second hand its around �80.

I have had a Blackberry Curve 9320 for approximately 6 months. Yesterday it died completely. No life whatsoever. I have tried everything - removing battery and replacing while on charge removing and replacing sim - nothing works. While on the charger the red light comes on for 20 seconds then goes out that is all. It is very annoying because my network provider, from whom I got it, won't replace it but will only send it for repair - so I am without it for 2 weeks.
 
 This is the second blackberry I have had that this has happened to. The first was a blackberry torch which died after 6 months in a similar fashion. Neither of the phones was used a great deal and had not been dropped or had water damage.

Have been using 9320 since Aug 2012
 Had heating problems and figured it was due to Whatsapp . Luckly Whatsapp released an update and that resolved the random heating problem. How I figured it was Whatsapp? The inbuilt battery diagnosis tool helped in figuring. It gives stats which app is using how much processing. Whatsapp stats were unusually high.
 
 This was in the initial month. Did not face that problem since,
 
 No other problems so far 
 
 I have not subscribed to BIS plans and using regular data plans
 Apps like logicmail are good enuf for my email needs 
 
 Viber works but on this model voice ip calls not supported
 No clue about Skype
 
 Audio quality for songs is good 
 Call quality is awesome
 In a crowded street can carry on with call without the other side getting disturbed by the background noise
 
 When I was using Samsung nexus i9250 people on other side always complained about background noise. This despite dualmic noise canceling. Ridiculous.; Have been using 9320 since Aug 2012

I have had this handset for quite a long time now. I've also been thinking of replacing it to the new iPhone 5 or soon to come out S4. But seriously, no matter how much I try, I still can't let this phone go. Regardless of the app restrictions, I just find this very easy & cheap to use. For the services it provides, other handsets would need full data plans to enjoy the handset anywhere & anytime. For this one, BB services are cheap & unlimited. I'd say, just keep this as a phone & buy an iPad 4/iPad Mini for all the other apps & games that this phone can't offer.

dozziy, 29 Mar 2013How do u do it?i'm fine thank you; i'm fine thank you
dozziy, 29 Mar 2013How do u do it?try this one:
 
 To save on battery:
 - make sure you are running os 7.1
 - make sure in Application Resource Manager, you have turned it on and automatic shut down of background applications.
 - set Battery Saving Mode to 30
 - turn off WiFi
 - turn Location Services off
 - set Backlight Brightness to 30
 - set Backlight Timeout to 20
 - do not use Mobile Hotspot unless really necessary
 - make sure NFC is not used.
 - limit or dont use social network stuff
 - make sure bluetooth is turned off
 - when charging, do not charge overnight, just until it is full then disconnect.
 This will help. Being on 3G is not a big drain on battery, so dont worry about that.
 I also rarely use the internet from a mobile so that has never been an issue for me.; try this one:
E12, 13 Mar 2013yeah.. you are right man! my battery for my bb 9320 will last for 3 days..How do u do it?; How do u do it?
nowadays, we are pretty much confused and anxious on which phone are we going to buy. what i could advise to you guys is to refer on how are you going to use the phone.
 
 1. if you want to be online 24/7 without worrying much about the battery, choose blackberry. it will only alert you and will use data if you really need it. im not sure if it goes the same with nokia handsets but with iphone and android, i dont think so. iphone 4/5 and android devices with 3G will give you at least 4-5 hours of continuous 3G connection even not browsing it at least. I own 9320 and my battery will give me at least 10-18 hours at least with minimal brwosing, always on with whatsapp and viber, bbm, fb chat, and real-time fb updates plus email.
 
 2. if you want to be online 24/7 and concerned about your budget? get a blackberry phone. im not sure about other countries but here in the philippines, we have options on how are we going to subscribe with blackberry data services. If we only want BBM, that's PHP99.00 per month, bbm plus email or social (YM, FB, Twitter, whatsapp, foursquare, viber, etc), that's PHP299 per month- though im not sure if 3rd party app is actually working on this but fb and twitter and YM are official. and if we want unli data plus all the services, that's PHP599 per month. normally, networks here in the philippines offer PHP1000-1200 for unli data subscription (with daily cap limit for globe).
 
 so it really depends. blackberry users are always online. though we dont have instagram, do you need it anyway? why not post pictures directly to facebook or twitter instead? i bet you have a lot more followers in twitter or facebook than with instagram! LOL.; nowadays, we are pretty much confused and anxious on which phone are we going to buy. what i could advise to you guys is to refer on how are you going to use the phone.

N that was probably one of the best decisions i have ever made! Its lightweight and the smallness of it is really cool for going places. I think this is the best curve yet. If u r not sure on getting this phone trust me get it and u will love it!

BB ADDICT, 03 Feb 2013the problem is the battery, i will charged it in full before i go to work and will leave it in... moreTo save on battery:
 - make sure you are running os 7.1
 - make sure in Application Resource Manager, you have turned it on and automatic shut down of background applications.
 - set Battery Saving Mode to 30
 - turn off WiFi
 - turn Location Services off
 - set Backlight Brightness to 30
 - set Backlight Timeout to 20
 - do not use Mobile Hotspot unless really necessary
 - make sure NFC is not used.
 - limit or dont use social network stuff
 - make sure bluetooth is turned off
 - when charging, do not charge overnight, just until it is full then disconnect.
 This will help. Being on 3G is not a big drain on battery, so dont worry about that.
 I also rarely use the internet from a mobile so that has never been an issue for me.
 I use a 9900, which people say can run out of battery but I have never had a problem. Also my wife has a 9320 which is a lot quicker than my 9900.
 Hope this helps everyone.; To save on battery:

I chose this phone over the Lenovo P700i because I want to try Blackberry's interface... at first i was confused with some of the options and very disappointed because it eats up my remaining balance even if i'm browsing only thru Wi-Fi... but after a few (but very complicated) adjustments, this phone is one of the best I had
 
 PROS:
 Very good battery life
 Smooth interface
 Easy to type even with one hand
 Good camera
 Fast Internet connection
 Clear sounds (music, videos, during calls)
 of course, BBM
 
 Cons:
 You need to have unlimited data plan for you to utilize the great features if you do not have wifi connection
 prone to scratches and fingerprints

I am a cell phone junkie and have used many brands and operating systems, but blackberry is ultimately a simple effecient and inexpensive way to be connected professionally
 I have been using the 9380 for the past 6 months and although a great phone the touch screen does make my interaction with the device more sluggish.
 I bought the 9320 last week and wow am I impressed 
 On Cell C as an outright purchase from Game in Johannesburg it costs R2399
 I am so happy to be back with a physical keyboard and this 9320 has an excellent keyboard.
 The battrey life seems to be a lot better than the 9380 and the phone responds well to browsing and other 3rd party apps I have installed

I just purchased the Blackberry Curve 9320 in black yesterday. Amazing phone for the price. If you are a gaming person then be warned this is not the phone for you. If you are a facebook/twitter/BBM person then this is a steal. Also excellent for first time smartphone users. This is a decent business phone but for a more serious one get the Bold 9900 or if you like gaming and business in one then the Torch 9310 might be good for you, might not. 
 The battery life is long and by far the longest on a curve. (6h+)
 The screen resolution is not very good but not so much as terrible.
 The keyboard, as usual, is excellent. I just really like real QWERTY keys and how Blackberry ones make you feel you are really pushing the keys down. Clicky.
 The Appstore definitely needs improvement. There is like 0 game apps for the curve.
 My Overall Rating: 4/5

 In which century you all are??
 All the companies all manufacturing good phones with almost all the features.
 Then why don't Blackberry??
 I love it that's why I am commenting to make it much better phone.
 It should also have Radio, Network Light, Dual Camera, Big screen in qwerty model with atleast 16M colors, with high resolution, crystal clear voice, light sensors and sound when heard from Speaker and earpiece, Bluetooth, very imp-very long battery life, two way charging option like Nokia E5-00 have, and rest of the things you can also think and design.

 *good display (does matter its 65k , but output it quite good)
 * excellent video recording quality
 * very good browsing speed with BIS
 * good multitasking
 * GPS response very good
 * surprisingly very good audio output
 * nice for all over connectivity like mail, SNS(twitter, FB etc)
 * 806 mhz processor doing good, doesn't hang 
 - points:-
 * battery will not last more than 1 day in heavy use,with moderate use it could last for 1/2 day more.
 * still pic quality is poor, i will not say bad, but to much of noise 
 * no separate usb cable given(in india), u ve to use the charger(detachable) cable in usb, its a pain.
 *back cover glossy, fingerprint prone.
 * blackberry service is mandatory for any connectivity
 
 i think it will help u all.

Just got this BB Curve 9320 last Saturday! All good and love the style and specs. Only that I am used to my Bold 9780 screen and Curve 9320 screen resolution is lower than that so that's the only thing I'm not satisfied with this phone. Other than that, I love the OS7.1, the wifi hotspot capability and it's thin and so lightweight.

Curve six or five (BB curve 9320) is a wonderful phone if you have ever used any of the BB phones. I have exhausted the bold family and the curve family and i tell you that that there are some features in this phone that even the analyst at the gsmarena might not have reported.
 in comparison to the samsung androids, i tell you i have the galaxy tab, galaxy s2 and note but you cannot actually compare the androids with the BBs, one android is all androids but one BB is not all BBs (think about that); Curve six or five (BB curve 9320) is a wonderful phone if you have ever used any of the BB phones.

Well, however the design is, a blackberry is still a blackberry, with limited app performance and not to mention storage shortage....
 
 i didnt hold grude to BB, seriously, i had one (mine was Keppler) but all blackberry no matter how expensive they may be, it's still less useless, and entertaining than the other smartphones...
 
 
 the main feature is BBM, that's all that make this handheld different from others...
 push email, etc....others can do it as well..
 
 but seeing the design and the material it used, i still prefer my Keppler than this one...the good part about 9320 is,it already support OS 7.1, and that's it..; Well, however the design is, a blackberry is still a blackberry, with limited app performance and not to mention storage shortage....

I have this phone for like 2 weeks already and it's so amazing. I love it! But I just got a problem though (not sure if this really is a problem) - I just can't change my theme. I've downloaded one form the BB World but couldn't use it. When I select the 'theme' option from the settings, it goes to the Home Screen Preference menu instead. I've tried downloading from other sites, installment is successful but same thing happened even if I restarted my phone. Do you guys have any idea what problem is? Is it because the OS is just new?

I bought a BB 9320 around 10-15 days back, my first handset had a problem. The browser always used to give me errors whenever i used to download content from internet. Second problems was battery. Despite of having 1450 mAh battery, it did last more than 12 hours. Although Blackberry claims 7 hours of talk time and 18 days of standbytime. Got my phone replaced and facing the same battery problem on another handset too. Both were Made in Canada - April 2012.

I got this phone for free 2 weeks ago, and its a good BB. A standard for BB. Features are good, especially with inclusion of FM Radio and Wi-Fi hotspot (at this price point). For the price point you can't go wrong. Good quality, good camera with flash, same great keyboard. I got this phone with Globe's Unlisurf Plan 999, overall i thing Globe's plan is a better deal than Smart's - its way too expensive and their network is repulsive, but having said that Globe's data speed is not as fast as I would like it to be, when i browse using mobile network or social app on my phone its at times quite slow, I know its the networks fault cos i am still using my 9900 - the free 9320 is collecting dust somewhere in the house now, just needed the sim - anyway when i was still in London browsing was so much quicker with their mobile data, plus os 7 browser is the best by far, I have iPhones and Android ICS phones and tablets, and with my tests os 7 browser is up there in the top spot.
 
 To haters, its a matter of choice and preference which form factor we prefer as individuals, ok. We love our keyboard and how very very very fast our e-mails get through (even in gprs with Globe)and also our BBM, me and my friends swear by it.
 
 This is a great phone for newbies and those who want to abandon their former OS or u can check out the BB Curve 9220 - main difference is 9320 has camera flash and 3G while the Curve 9220 doesnt have it, I can confirm it as my freinds have Curve 9220 and as I said I have 9320 - somewhere.

I have bought this phone a week after it was announced here in the Philippines. I had about 2 android phones before I bought this phone. My last android phone was GALAXY S II, but I sold it because I wanted to try a BLACKBERRY handset. Since I am very particular with Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking, I must say that this handset gives me what I need. It delivers. 
 
 People would say,"oh, Blackberry? Your money would just be wasted. The specs could not compete with android and iOS" -- Ofcourse it can't. Blackberry wasn't made for playing temple run or stuff like that. It was made for young professionals and businessmen, and now, people that are into socializing with the use of BBM. If you prefer playing with your phone and doing ton of stuff with it, buy an iPhone or an Android handset. Not this one.
 
 The Blackberry pricing, to my own opinion, may have been based on it's users -- young professionals and businessmen. These people could "afford" this type of handset. That's why it's price range is like that. And admit it, before all this apple and android stuff ever happened, a man with a Blackberry phone looks stylish and professional.
 
 If you are looking for functionality and practicality, sure, go for Apple and Android. It gives your money justice. But blackberry is Blackberry.
 
 For me, it gives what I want and what I need as a professional. Document viewing and editing, Social networking, BBM (Which is I think the best thing that Blackberry has ever made), Music, Camera (For God sake, get a DSLR to take great pictures, not your phone), and many more.
 
 My personal suggestion, Don't buy a BLACKBERRY handset if you are not a fan of it's capabilities and features. 
 
 Personally, I love blackberry, but I'll be buying an iPod touch for the other features I want. Not putting all those features in an iPod touch on my phone is an advantage. You see, an iPhone or an Android phone requires lots of battery power because of it's capabilities. All those stuff that's going through those handsets would suck so much of it's life, resulting to over usage, which will eventually lead to deterioration. I wouldn't want that to happen to my phone. That's why I am keeping my Blackberry as my PHONE, and that iPod touch as a TOY.; I have bought this phone a week after it was announced here in the Philippines.

Honestly and telling you guy, please think 500 times before buying any of the blackberry smart phone.
 RIM is only making fool of the peoples by selling the products at very high prices and even
 then you will not be satisfied. plz dont go for this. I have spoiled my entire 15K for this 
 cell. Frankly speaking if any buyer for even 10K i would be able to find out I will sell this and
 get someone from htc, samsung with more features. Another drawback is for using internet
 you have to spend min 400 per month. Sound quality very low, ringtone max vol is too low, 
 battery life very less. I am writing so much because i dont want others to be in tension.; Honestly and telling you guy, please think 500 times before buying any of the blackberry smart phone.

The BB 9320 is a good phone for its price. The camera has high MP, its OS 7.1, its quite faster, slimmer and lighter compared to the other phones belonging in its price range. The battery life of this phone is quite better than the battery life of my previous phone (BB 9300), it can last a full 24 hours. But if you prioritize the battery life of your phone, i suggest you go with a Nokia handset. or if not, i suggest an extra battery pack or a portable charger.

i buy this phone at 31 May 2012
 I'm already tested and is a really amazing
 all i want the spec is already in here :)
 + using 16GB microSD Class 10 by Transcend
 I can play LossLess Audio (FLAC) on this BB + WiFi + Good Camera
 well ... i'm not expert of BB like Sanjay :D
 coz, this is my 1st phone of BB
 But ... since i using this phone, the battery not really poor :)
 I use automatic network switch between 2G & 3G systems. so ... my battery can have a longer life :p
 This phone not to spend more money :)
 my WiFi always ON also with program BBM Function + YM + MSN + WhatsApp + FB
 i choose this phone coz already have a Radio function
 I already saw all BB not have Radio
 But, this time is different.
 You can choose BB with your budged. Like Sanjay said before, want some experience ?? buy a high spec BB
 Cost of a budget ??? Choose carefully which one BB you want to buy
 See the spec and your budget :)
 
 This phone is a really amazing
 1st time have own BB, and configure it by myself
 wOw .... really make "Like A Boss"
 :D

I am a true BB lover and I've been using them for quite sometime now. It is in fact quite disappointing to see the same good old blacberry design every single time they release a new phone. I now started thinking that BB has to invest on something new, if they want to bounce back into the business. I wouldn't have been using the BB's if it was not for BIS (I mean its been enough of the same old design (just like putting some new dress on a granny)); I am a true BB lover and I've been using them for quite sometime now.

[deleted post]yeah obviously syncing on 3G mode consumes more power when compared to 2G.since 9320 being a 3g mobile and BIS(BB Internet Services) offering 24hr sync in such cases the battery offers a poor backup..my bro has got this fone and the battery is really poor during syncing on 3g..so he disabled the 3g option and using the same services on 2g..now its better :)
 
 But the battery backup is always better than 9790 which has 1230mah and 16M high resolution display in contrast to 65k display on 9320 with a non touch screen..
 
 but ill tell u some thing BB os7 looks like a shit on 9320 and if u really wanna enjoy BB os7 interface simply go for 9790 which has got an extra ordinary display for viewing..
 
 9320 is simply a budget concern fone..which is to be considered as successor to BB curve3G 9300 which offers same display but a better camera and outlook with a chrome strip running around it.; yeah obviously syncing on 3G mode consumes more power when compared to 2G.since 9320 being a 3g mobile and BIS(BB Internet Services) offering 24hr sync in such cases the battery offers a poor backup..my bro has got this fone and the battery is really poor during syncing on 3g..so he disabled the 3g option and using the same services on 2g..now its better :)

This phone was realeased in the uk only 10-15 pounds more than the 9220. So ideally it should have been rupees 12000, 13000. I'm sure in three to five months the price of this phone will drop, and this phone will be ideal for the Indian market. However the younger generation might opt for the 9220 as it is available in more vibrant colours.; This phone was realeased in the uk only 10-15 pounds more than the 9220.

Hi! Dear Friends, Can any body tell me that which should i buy? Either Blackberry Curve 9360 or 9320? I want to know in details so my doubt will be cleared. I am going to buy first time Blackberry mobile phone. My doubt is that;
 
 1. 9360 has 800 MHZ Processor rather 9320 it doesn't have so is it con for 9320? Will the speed affect to multitasking?
 2. I heard and searched on net that 9360 has very poor battery (1000mAh) only and 9320 has (1430mAh) so will it be affect on use of 9360?
 3. Which is better for multipurpose use?
 Most users given negative feedback about 9360 and given positive feedback about 9320 so i am confuse and worried about it. So i request you kindly help me to take decision. I am getting confuse because my heart says that 9360 is best because it has:
 
 Pros
 
 1. 480*360 Resolution
 2. 264 Pixel Density
 3. NFC Availability
 4. 5 Mega Pixel Camera
 5. 800 MHZ Processor
 
 Cons
 
 1. No FM Radio
 2. No Wi-Fi Hot Spot Tethering
 3. Very Poor Battery Life (1000mAh) only
 4. No Accelerometer, Proximity Compass Sensor
 
 So these are some points which are creating confusion in my heart. My mind says that i should go for 9320 because it has;
 
 Pros
 
 1. FM Radio
 2. Wi-Fi Hot Spot Tethering
 3. Accelerometer, Proximity Compass Sensor
 4. 1450 mAh battery
 
 Cons
 
 1. 320*240 Resolution
 2. No NFC Availability
 3. No Processor/CPU
 
 So i heartily request you that kindly help me and clear my doubt. I will be very grateful to you. I hope you will reply me soon. I am awaiting for your reply. Please reply me as soon as possible because probably i am going to buy this mobile The Day After Tomorrow. Thank you very much. Have a nice day. Take care. Thanks a lot in advance! Please Help!; Hi!

I got this phone in April 2012. I used to have the Bold series from my company but I switched jobs and this company provided us with Curve 9360.
 
 It is very different from Bold. The quality is just not there. I loved my Bold but this Curve is just a bad phone. I had software issues right at the beginning. Later the camera died. My colleagues hated this phone. There were so many complains to our company IT that they phased out all BB and asked us to use Iphone or androids.
 
 Battery life is good if you use 2G.
 3G and wifi will sap the battery very quickly.
 Phone reception is good. Voice quality decent and the speaker phone is adequate (good for conference calls).
 
 The supplied headphones are of bad quality. malfunctioned very quickly.
 
 This phone was manufactured at the Czech Republic. I am not sure if different manufacturing plants produces different quality.; I got this phone in April 2012.

This is my first bb, so I'm probably the worst person to read for a review if you looking for someone with a hands-on background approach with bb phones, but I've had a fair share of other phones... nokia, sony, samsung. This phone is fast. And I'm not talking cheetah fast, I'm talking 744 bowing. I've never had a phone this fast. The graphics is very nice, and the memory is brilliant @ 500MB, no my brother that's very fast. The middle button is a touch pad, which is actually very clever when you think about it - the old navigation buttons break. The phone is good what else can I say?; This is my first bb, so I'm probably the worst person to read for a review if you looking for someone with a hands-on background approach with bb phones, but I've had a fair share of other phones... nokia, sony, samsung.

I saw most of the comment said the phone was poor. But I think it's not fair to Blackberry. I work at Cell Phone Bussiness. So most of the time I will have the new demo phone to use(S3, Note2, S4......)But beside the demo, I have a BB9360 for Personal Phone.
 And almost all the email, message, write memo.....I used on BB9360. Coz BB setting is good for bussiness use. But if I watch video, playing game, take picture.... I will use Note2/S4. 
 I have a suggestion for people who planing to buy this phone(or new model Q5)If you want to use your smart phone like computer(Games/Photo/Browsing/Skype....)I will suggest you buy a Android device. But if you want to buy a phone only for bussiness(Email/Message/Memo/Appoint...) use or you will carry 2 cell phone. BB9360 is a not bad choice. Coz the size small and thin. Make u easy to carry(Note3 for man a little too big to carry without hand bag.)Everytime when I need to make a call, my mind will take out the BlackBerry without thinking. Only when I want to use some special apps, then I will take out the note. 
 And some people said the phone battery life is short. I can share a expreience with you. I use bluetooth headset with the BB9360. Normally when I plug the phone to charge before I sleep. The phone still have around 40-50% Battery(around 09:00am to 11:30PM, use a lot of email and message)But suddenly have a week, everyday at 04:00PM the phone out of battery already. Make me need to charge twice a day. I check my battery is no problem. After a week, I need to use my SIM to test another phone. Then unplug the battery around 30 mins. Then I restart my phone, the battery life go back to normal. This experience make me everytime the battery life have problem, I will unplug the battery 30mins( I try only restart/turn off the phone 30mins was useless, only work for unplug battery and let the phone take a break)
 
 Blackberry this 1-2 years bussiness keep dropping down becoz their company direction was wrong. For example like Restaurant, Blackberry keep want to be a nice restaurant focus on special food. But all people want buffet restaurant. That make them keep lose to Iphone and Android. But their phone's material/qulity mostly better then you paid. Now Blackberry have a new CEO is Asian People, I wish they can find a new way to get back the market. Coz Canada only have 1 cell phone company brand >BlackBerry.; I saw most of the comment said the phone was poor. But I think it's not fair to Blackberry. I work at Cell Phone Bussiness.

I've fixed this phone 5 times.

If I could, I would put this phone of the market because its performance is highly abominable. Please do not purchase this phone if you don't want unnecessary frustrations every now and then.

I would not reccomend anyone to get this phone because as you put it on 3G and 2G you may feel it starts warming up even though you not browsing. I really loved this phone but just got bored of it now. The buttons on the side also sink in making it difficult for you to press them with ease. A tip I'd like to give everyone who still wants this phone is: don't overcharge your phones or it'll cause a defective battery. Don't regret buying this phone though but moving on to Sony.; Got this phone in Sept 2012. I would not reccomend anyone to get this phone now as it is quite old now.

If there's one major problem with this phone I had was its overheating.I thought it was a bomb.it really pissed me off. But I found a solution to the problem by switching the network to 2G only and putting the brightness of the phone to 50% and it hasn't been overheating only when downloading it does a little.

Horrible battery life, and phone hangs like hell. Sometimes switches off when you take pics. When phones dies, sometimes takes hours of charging before it switches on. Just not worth it. My phone is 5 months old. Getting a Samsung. Had same problem with other BBs. I really would not recommend this hone- even on a budget.; Horrible battery life, and phone hangs like hell.

Good phone but battery life sucks!! I always bring my charger with me.
 
 My advice is .. 
 1. Turn off Wifi if not using it. 
 2. Switch from 3G to 2G if 3G is not necessary. 
 3. Set brightness to at least 30.; Good phone but battery life sucks!! I always bring my charger with me.; My advice is ..; 1. Turn off Wifi if not using it.; 2. Switch from 3G to 2G if 3G is not necessary.; 3. Set brightness to at least 30.

Shabeeb, 20 Feb 2013In blackberry curve 9360 and 9320 Which is more better in performance and battey long lasting .Well in performance i think the blackberry 9320 is better. It is much faster 2 get 2 apps, and OS 7.1. And in battery 9320 is miles better. The 9360 can last 4 about half a day on till u have 2 charge it. However 9320 goes a full 2 days and can go about a day and a little if ur a heavy user if u dont know what 2 pick, in my opinion u would be much happier with a 9320; Well in performance i think the blackberry 9320 is better.

I am hating this phone so much right now #screaming!
 Bought it December 2011. Battery life is terrible. So, it switches radio off when it's low. It loses the calender dates so appointment times are unreliable. It refuses to validate email passwords sometimes. It refuses to receive emails (primary reason I bought this sorry excuse of a contraption). Lately, the contact list has gone missing permanently, like skipped town. Has done this like a deferral junkie and i'd switch it off and on and it's return. Did I mention the recurring "Media Card Removed" that keep popping up and one has to watch in horror until it's had its fill before attempting to use the phone! I regret ever purchasing this and I have another year to go on contract.; I am hating this phone so much right now #screaming!; Bought it December 2011. Battery life is terrible.

I just completed a year using the phone, as of now not a single trouble, a very good phone for its amount.
 cons: the battery life isnt that good
 and while downloading something or accessing web, the battery gets heated up too much, infact if u have a habit of gossiping a lot over phone, I suggest you look for other options

FM radio is available on the phone post a software update to 7.1 OS. For people who posted comments about battery life well in OS 7 battery life is certainly pathetic but after the update battery improves tremendously as there is a battery saving mode in the options section along with a application resource monitor. Both features when activated help keep the battery discharge rate down. OS 7.1 also adds the mobile hotspot feature I saw previously in 9930. All in all a good blackberry to buy and use provided you are able to update your software. Mostly it will not show any update to your software via the desktop manager and you will be stuck on OS 7. Don't cry till you try. Don't always go by user opinions as well preferable to read specs provided by GSMArena folks as that is always better and 95% accurate.; FM radio is available on the phone post a software update to 7.1 OS.

Brilliant phone. Thin enough to feel comfortable but just enough weight to make you feel like you're using a real qwerty phone. build quality is superb. feels like a Bold, rather than a low-end Curve.

If blackberry wanted to disappoint customers, they really hit the mark here. The worst least powerful battery ever on 9360.
 As it heats up a lot I wonder if in fact the whole range of batteries have a design flaw. They should be recalled and replaced with better batteries, this is a shame.; If blackberry wanted to disappoint customers, they really hit the mark here.

I had many of the current qwerty bb on os 5,6,7 and now 7.1. Had the bold 9000 and 9900, had the curve 8900 (first bb), curve 9360 and now a curve 9220. Yes it seems a downgrade, but its really not. I can explain: I have two phones, being a bb fan for ages I have a private phone (iPhone 4s) and a bb (all the time) for a business phone. I've loved all my bb, but he curve form factor always had a special corner in my bb fan heart. The 9360 has one problem ( a single one): its battery. For hat reason o bought a 9220 with no 3 g, a less resolution screen and a less demanding hardware in terms of battery usage. My 9360 lasted 3/4 of a day with luck, my 9229 lasts 3 days easy. You can trust me. For work and general use, the 9220 is a more usable bb. I hope os10 can make want to sell my iPhone and by one for a private phone.

This is the 4th Blackberry that I have used, and by far the worst. The phone heats up even when not in use, and the battery gets discharged on its own in about 3 hours. Mails to RIM are returned saying that "complaints should be through proper channel".; This is the 4th Blackberry that I have used, and by far the worst.

The BB 9360 is the biggest piece of crap I have ever owned! DO NOT BUY 1!!! I got this phone on contract with Nashua Mobile for 2 years in Jan 2012 and it has been giving me problems ever since! The battery lasts between an hour or two max,(I dont even make calls, bbms, if i do, then half an hour)! it literally lives in the charger. I bought a car charger, spare batt, the works and i cant even send too many bbm's when im out cos the battery will die! it freezes so often for no reason, I have to keep rebooting it! and the track pad is now screwed up. it keeps jumping around and doesn't go into the files i want it to go into. when i click into a file, it now doesn't respond! Its in repairs now. I wish i never bought it!; The BB 9360 is the biggest piece of crap I have ever owned! DO NOT BUY 1!!!

Hi, this is my 2nd 9360. I got the first one in May this year. The keypad is my main concern. The paint peels around the edges of the keypad and makes the phone look really old.

Is there anyway that Blackberry can just sort this out... Cos its really annoying paying for something and not being 100% happy with it...

Hi everyone,
 
 I�m using my new 9360 for one month right now and today I noticed that this one seems to have the exact same problem as the 2 other 9360's I had before.
 
 during an incoming call, the MP3 ringtone I use sounds real funny (Mick Jagger sounds like Katy Perry on the buttom of the ocean) and when I re-listen to that MP3 using my Media player, the ringtone sounds pretty normal. Solving the problem by updating my baby to the highest level is horseplay. (won't work, believe me), this feels like a hardware issue to me. besides, the speakers for media player and incoming calls are different.
 
 A quick battery remove helps to get this problem 'sorted' but unfortunately only for a day or two.
 
 as a BlackBerry retailer i sold hundreds of these units before but no-one else seems to have this problem (at least, they don't complain..) Bad luck or am I the only one who's worrying about this problem. you tell me!; Hi everyone,; I�m using my new 9360 for one month right now and today I noticed that this one seems to have the exact same problem as the 2 other 9360's I had before.; during an incoming call, the MP3 ringtone I use sounds real funny (Mick Jagger sounds like Katy Perry on the buttom of the ocean) and when I re-listen to that MP3 using my Media player, the ringtone sounds pretty normal.

Is there any one here who experienced JVM 545? I badly need help as I'm gonna die coz my BB is havving it. I love BB so much that the only thing I don't like about it is the small screen. It has far greater display than Androids as I'm now using iPhone4, Android and iPad, but I prefer my BB still. It's the best phone I ever had. It's faster than iPhone when it comes to instant messaging and emails, browsing via its native browser, calling and texting as well. I love the calcu too, the memopad, the camera, the video cam, the vid and mp3 player, I love everything. The battery, well, when I multitask, it gets hot which is normal as iPhone and Android does and I do understand that. But somehow, I'm so busy socializing, I think it could last me, like half day. I don't have any other probs with it except for the scroll in SMS and it restarts when it gets hot, maybe I think to avoid overload. So still understandable. All in all it's a very good phone.; Is there any one here who experienced JVM 545? I badly need help as I'm gonna die coz my BB is havving it.

this is a really good phone to get if you have a limited budget because it does all one really needs in a smartphone. However I'd advise you purchase an extra battery along with the phone as the battery life isn't all that great. I've had to turn off the 3G radio in order to get any meaningful battery life out of it along with turning down brightness etc. But if you dont browse the net or download files often then this is a solid phone to get. The battery saving mode offered in the OS 7.1 upgrade is a big help and of course fm radio is a plus(it was built with the features but the os didnt support it at the time).; this is a really good phone to get if you have a limited budget because it does all one really needs in a smartphone.

I've had this phone for 4 months. It came with OS 7.0 installed and after having used a Curve 8320 for 4 years I was shocked with how short the battery life (why only a 1000mAh battery??) I had to shut off GPS and 3G to get it to last an entire work day otherwise the battery would drain in about 10 hours. I've since upgraded the OS to 7.1.0.523 which helped with resource management and battery life is better. I still keep 3G off most of the time and keep GPS off at all times unless absolutely needed. At best (very little use of the web browser and only text messaging/instant messaging) I've been able to get 35-40 hours on a single charge. I'm wondering why RIM didn't figure out how to get a 1450mAh battery like with the Curve 9320??; I've had this phone for 4 months.

I've had my Blackberry curve 9360 for over a month now. I think its a great device. My device is running OS7.1 and the battery lasts a day and a half. The camera takes good pics and the led flash works fine. The trackpad is smooth and responsive. The screen is great. May not be the best screen in terms of technical specs but its pleasing to the eyes. The keyboard is a gem. I have large fingers and I still find it quite comfortable. OS is very fast no lagging with this baby. web pages sometimes take a little while to load but after all its only running on 800Mhz. I love this phone. Its actually my first Blackberry and it has given me a very plesant introduction. great job BB.; I've had my Blackberry curve 9360 for over a month now. I think its a great device.

This is my first Blackberry. It has a great camera, very clear images. Very fast internet connection and great for all social media types [i.e: Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo Messanger, Email, etc...]� so those who enjoy their social media interaction then BB is probably a gd gadget for them. But as I dont want these coming thru to my BB every few seconds I find it very annoying indeed when the blasted thing kps beeping every few mins to let me knw another msg frm one of these social-media types has come thru, which takes up my battery life very quickly. Tried finding a way to shut them dwn [or off completely], but so far cannot find a way to do so. I have to charge my battery every dy even tho I dont use the phone every day. Find it difficult to find help and solutions to what I 'do' not want my BB to do [even when I go thru the 'Help' appl and the small instruction booklet has very little info to help u with problems and hw to operate the BB. I was also very disappointed with very little choice of ringtones compared to the other older mobiles I have had in the past [none-BB mobiles]�where I had such a wide choice. And cannot find much 'free' ringtones to dwnload frm the internet as there seems to be a wider selection if u are willing to pay for them....and the prices are quite expensive so not interested in dwnloading them at all. I must say I agree with most opinions here abt its battery life�its the worst I have �EVER� had and that is jst not acceptable when I have paid a lot for it. Also find it extremely difficult to remove the back when I nd to change the sim card. It is very thin and will not take much for it to break or snap in half. Even my son and husband said the same. Overall I give the BB Curve 9360 a rating of 4 out of 10, and I will �NEVER� purchase another BB �EVER��.I think they are over-rated and over-priced and nd to be redesigned and upgraded to a better standard of use.If u c an afford to do so it would be better to have a BB for buisness or/and social-media, AND have another ordinary mobile phone of your choice which u r happy with [thats if u dont mind having two mobiles].I am considering selling my BB Curve and jst continue using my old mobile instead as I had so much more pleasure and use out of it.; This is my first Blackberry.

 As a phone it is missing a lot of what might make a real difference. Ways behind the point older symbian NOKIA smartphones reached in terms of usability and reliable communication.

Absolute rubbish phone!!!!! Battery overheats and doesn't charge properly. Battery goes dead really quick. Constantly having to update things on this phone which I think is a disgrace because you shouldn't have to go through all that trouble jus to b able to get your phone to work! Even wen I do update things on the phone, it doesn't go any faster..... Infact I wud say it slows it down even more. I've had two replacements of this phone because of the battery overheating and not working properly. Only good thing about this phone is the memory. Seriously people DONT buy this phone, Infact don't buy any sort of cackberry cuz ther all crap and need to stop being sold! They are a waste of time and money. Js; Absolute rubbish phone!!!!!

Well I have had my eye on the cheapest blackberry bold that is available in South Africa,forgot which one it was,but its still a lot of money to pay for a damn phone! So I bought my Curve 8520 in 2010,it was a very cool smartphone,only started to get the hang of it and how to use all the features and applications and earlier this year in 2012 it started with his shit!! Some of my keys of the keypad got stuck especially the A key and it got more difficult to type a message,it was so frustrating,I wanted to break the phone. Then I got a stupid brainwave and read on the internet about how to open a BB curve phone-i think I hurt the phone when I tried to open it, so I closed it again and the phone was never the same again! It goes on and so on but it says no service! Can it be repaired,? Never try this at home-rather take it to a technichian who knows how to fix a phone. So eventually I had to get a new phone,because I can't live without my bb phone,but stupid me,I bought the same damn bb Curve 8520-but I'm still paying it off! But now I want the 9360 blackberry Curve is it worth buying?

Piece of shit. From the day I bought it, the the stupid thing had hiccups from hell. Too many to name. One of the worst ones is when I open a text message to read, at times it will scroll up and at times it won�t scroll at all. It doesn�t scroll up more than it actually scrolls. It�s a real piss off when someone sends you a long text because you can�t read the whole thing since you can�t scroll up or down. I have to take the battery out and put it back in and then wait for the phone to load up again to be able to scroll. Also, if you want to go back up to read an older message, the scroll is very needed and in this stupid phone�s case, that doesn�t work very well either.
 It doesn�t have a lot of space of pictures. My ancient flip phone had more space for pictures than this thing. 
 The light on the damn thing goes on and off whenever it wants. During the day it�s fine, but during the night it�s hard to text when the keys aren�t lighted up and you can�t see anything.

Hi there. Please can someone advise me on whether to get the Curve 9380 or the 9360. I have been reading up and everyone is complaining about the batteries in both phones.

The phone is amazing. It's fast and snappy. Also, all BB devices have battery lives of up to only six or seven hours so this isn't an issue for the specific phone.

Hi guys,
 Today I got the 7.1 OS update for my 9360. This upgrade z officialy released in India on 12 July 2012. One can get in touch with their nearest Blackberry service station, to get their device upgraded. This upgrade really provides U radio, mobile hot spot & few other features.; Hi guys,; Today I got the 7.1 OS update for my 9360. This upgrade z officialy released in India on 12 July 2012.

Despite the opinions i have been reading on here for the past week now, i went ahead and got this phone yesterday. This phone is great. I've upgraded to 7.1(available on Blackberry Desktop Manager) where i now have radio and the battery life is good. I guess the upgrade gave better performance with this phone. My advice to anyone who wants to get this is to go right ahead; Despite the opinions i have been reading on here for the past week now, i went ahead and got this phone yesterday. This phone is great.

Had this phone about a week now, and generally I'm very happy with it. I use it for work purposes, taking calls and accessing emails. Subsequently I use it on 2G not 3G. The battery life is not amazing, but it can go two to three days with light to moderate use.
 
 The qwerty keyboard is easy to use and comfortable as well. I think I can probably type faster on my iPhone, but I'm more accurate with the physical keyboard. Call quality is excellent and I love that you can customise so many aspects of the phone (from the convenience key through to having the phone automatically turn on and off at specified times).
 
 I also like having the LED indicator, this is something I find very useful in an office environment. Not used the camera as it's not something I brought the phone to use, I'm sure it's ok, but traditionally BB's have never had particularly great camera's. I've also yet to use NFC, but I'm keen to give this a go.
 
 BB OS7.1 is a significant improvement on my previous experience with BB OS5. That said one thing I will never understand with Blackberry's is the inability to sync with data in existing email sub-folder; only new emails show, not existing ones!?! BBM is also much better than iMessage, which is always a bit temperamental (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't). Having an inbuilt office suite is particularly useful for the odd bit of light editing.
 
 Web-browsing is not that great. I imagine that with a touch screen it would be ok, but with the tracker pad it's painfully slow. Web-pages can be a little slow to load, but that's about the only time you really see any lag in the OS. Customised mobile sites are ok, but that's about it. This isn't really an issue with me as I use my iPhone for surfing the web. I only really need this phone for secure email and voice calls.
 
 Final words - generally a good phone, but if you want a phone for browsing the web then look elsewhere. For those who've used BB's in the past be warned that battery life isn't as good as in previous models, but OS7.1 is generally a pleasure to use.; Had this phone about a week now, and generally I'm very happy with it.

I've been using it for half a month and I am still hooked with this phone. The heating problem is normal for 3G phones especially if you're a heavy-web user and there are a lot of applications opened so as to avoid it, only use one app at a time. I also had this dilemma but it went away because i learned how to respect my phone and that is to not use to open too many apps at a time, i only open like 2 to 3. And with regard to the BATTERY, of course it runs out faster especially if you are using the NET on 3G mode like any other phone does, what I suggest is turn your phone in to 2G connection when not using your phone (example: in your pocket, or while travelling) and just turn it back to 3G if you will be using the net. That's why I do, anyway you will also receive your notifications in FB, TWITTER, BBM and other social networking sites so don't worry that you will be missing them! BLACKBERRY PHONES may not seem to be a fun phone but it is by far the smartest phone Ive had. This surely kills the Apple phones. It's very sleek but I can do almost everything with this phone. I can even download songs and vids in just a jiffy. Better get this phone!; Shut Up man! I believe BB Curve 9360 is the best phone by far.

Heating problem of this model has been sorted out.
 
 1. This phone is released with Os 7.0 which BETA version, these will always have bugs for any phone, make and model. Beta mean the 1st release of a new OS which has not been perfected yet. Its only software not hardware.
 Eg. Of beta Os is 7.0.0.353 this is 7.0 os
 
 2. What you don't know is that BETA heating problem stops after 2 weeks..the phone gradually settles temperature. I understand nobody can't wait two weeks.
 
 3. This Os version 7.1.0.391 is the latest Os as of this date...NO HEATING it activates FM Radio...yes this phone has FM Radio.
 
 4. To view your os version on 9360 
 Go to options ...Press "a" key and
 Click on "about device"
 
 5. There many os 7.0 and 7.1 
 Eg. Os 7.0 types = 7.0.0.353

 The above versions cannot activate your FM radio.
 
 EG. Of os 7.1 = 7.1.0.186
 7.1.0.336

 Your FM radio will available on those Os above.
 No heating, and better battery life. However 336 and 391 best so far.

Great Phone just buy this 2nd June.
 I urged you to buy this Phone, and many asks how to make the battery lasts longer.
 There are 2 ways:
 1. Buy a new higher Capacity battery. (Mine is Hippo Cell Japan Which is 1600mAh, original BB battery only 1000mAh, which is great)
 2. You can charge the battery with a portable charger, like Universal Charger. It may takes a longer time to charge (approx. 4 hours), but the battery will last longer too!
 
 What happens if we combine way 1 with way 2? Well I got my battery discharge rate average is only approx. 0.5%/hour!!!!
 
 Don't hesitate yourself! it's a good phone.
 
 But not having an autofocus is a great trouble, but it's okay.

I was delighted with my new BB 9360 from UK Vodafone shop but a bit annoyed when some emails wouldn't delete. It has now gone back to Vodafone as it got very very hot and the batt drained in minutes. I am disappointed that the shop would not replace the handset as it is only 8 weeks old, however I look forward to getting it back eventually. If you have stuck emails which won't delete, connect the handset to your PC via Blackberry Desktop software and you can delete stuck item from there.Even if desktop shows no messages, click delete.; I was delighted with my new BB 9360 from UK Vodafone shop but a bit annoyed when some emails wouldn't delete.

Hi ... I am planning to pick up a Curve 9360. My usage will be about 3-4 hours of calls a day. BBM,SMS, chatting on GTalk Yahoo etc and EDGE use. I don't need 3G. I will not be using it for listening to music or watching videos. May be about 10 mins of video usage at most. My question is how long do you guys think will battery last in case of such usage. 
 
 Will it atleast last a day ?
 
 I know it can differ with people and usage. But I thought putting in my clear requirements will help as I dont think it's fair to blame this phone's battery if you want a Entertainment device.

I have had the 9360 for about 2 weeks now and I'm in love! I had the old Curve for 2 years that ram OS 5/6? and the one complaint I always had was the browser. Well, no more! With OS 7 you can actually open REAL web pages! And it's so much faster! It may not be an android or Iphone, but if you are getting a BB in the 1st place, games and apps probably aren't your 1st priority anyway! But there definitely is a few more decent apps to choose from now. And a free one I recommend is "Battery Enhancer." I thought I noticed the battery was running down kinda quick, figured it was all the new toys I was playing with : ) But with this app, maybe its my imagination, but it seems to not drain as quickly.

But there definitely is a few more decent apps to choose from now. And a free one I recommend is "Battery Enhancer." I thought I noticed the battery was running down kinda quick, figured it was all the new toys I was playing with : ) But with this app, maybe its my imagination, but it seems to not drain as quickly.; Hope this helps some of you that are on the fence!

Hi All,
 
 I want to buy a Blackberry mobile-may be in a month's time. My requirements are:
 
 1.Good battery life
 2.Good processor
 3.Ease of use(user friendliness)
 4.Reasonable camera performance
 5.Qwerty key pad
 6.Good music quality

 What I don't want:
 
 1.Touchscreen
 2.Playing games 
 3.Watching video
 
 The phone will be used mostly for official work.So, nothing better than BB,I think. Accessing net 
 for entertainment will be part-time job.
 
 I am a middle level banker and have so far mostly used Nokia phones( using C7 and E72 presently).
 My budget for this new handset is around 30K.

To begin with, never give a opinion of any device until you have owned it between 3 to 6 months at the earliest. I have read some of the reviews about the heating of the phone when charging, that's normal for anything that has a rechargeable battery. The battery only lasting for so long. If you don't let any rechargeable battery die out for at least for the first 3 charges, you are going to put a memory of the battery and you cannot change that once it is done to any rechargeable battery. For instance...you only wait (in the first 3 charges) for the battery to get down to only 25%, you will always ONLY get 75% of usage out of the battery.
 A highburnerr of battery power is tolight-upp your display. With Blackberry, you can adjust the display in the Screen/Keyboard options, then theback lightt Brightness. TheBack lightt Timeout, if it is set to low and you are continuing to have the phone light back up, change the length longer. Each time it comes on, it is taking more power at startup than if you moved the time to 45 seconds than to keep it at 30 seconds.; To begin with, never give a opinion of any device until you have owned it between 3 to 6 months at the earliest.

for me 9360 is not that bad at all.. i bought it to a legitimate Blackberry shops with warranty and stuffs.. issue in the battery it can be solve, it depends of our usage. 
 
 Tip
 1. goto 20% of brightness
 2. off wifi, blueT if not in use
 3. use your social media, pushmails etc.. if necessary (not always)
 
 by doing this 3 dayz max our batts will last..
 
 for me 9360 is a very nice smartphone if you need games, maps, music or just to kill time. buy an iPod or iPad practicality wise. Blackberry is for 2go person only. this is not a PSP consule or a notebook... see the clear picture guyz.. :D; for me 9360 is not that bad at all.. i bought it to a legitimate Blackberry shops with warranty and stuffs.. issue in the battery it can be solve, it depends of our usage.; Tip; 1. goto 20% of brightness; 2. off wifi, blueT if not in use; 3. use your social media, pushmails etc.. if necessary (not always); by doing this 3 dayz max our batts will last..; for me 9360 is a very nice smartphone if you need games, maps, music or just to kill time. buy an iPod or iPad practicality wise.

Got my BB more than a week ago, and I'm liking the push e-mail, the main reason I opted for it. Battery is not the best, but it's tolerable. For moderate/heavy use (Wifi and Internet), it lasts a full day. For just e-mail and texts, it can last three days. Overall, I guess 9360 is a good phone. The only big disappointment is the camera. It's way, way outdated, notwithstanding it's 5 MP. The cam has no use for me; it's pictures are not worth looking at, much less posting anywhere. My other phone, Sony Ericcson K800i, a 3 MP, which I bought in 2006, creates far better pics. And I'll be keeping my K800i for some snapshots.; Got my BB more than a week ago, and I'm liking the push e-mail, the main reason I opted for it. Battery is not the best, but it's tolerable.

I've been using my Blackberry Curve 9360 for two weeks and I must say that this is a great phone. At first, I encountered the issues that were posted here like continous reboot, short battery life, heating issues, etc. I found the solution to these issues from the forums that I found on the internet. I updated my OS to version 7.1.0.258 and it solved the battery and heating issues right away. Because version 7.1.0.258 has a battery saving option that extends the battery life. Now, my phone lasts more that 24 hours with average calls and texts, Facebook and Blackberry Messenger from time to time and browsing the internet. Also, with the continous reboot issue, you just need to re-install the OS of your phone. Try to search for "how to repair a nuked blackberry" and that will take you to the solution for the continous reboot.
 
 In short, I can say that this is a great phone if you know how to use and tweak it to achieve its full potential.; I've been using my Blackberry Curve 9360 for two weeks and I must say that this is a great phone.

 blackberries only good if you are in blackberries communitiy.
 notice the cpu in blackberries, you may get faster dual core cpu for android phones with same unit price.
 you can do your 3G skype face to fce conversation while blackberries dont even have secondary camera

I got this phone 2 days ago so far no problem with it except the battery. Battery lasted for about ten hours but usage was pretty heavy with calls, bbm, sms and capturing photos with one of my events.

Camera is also nice at 5 megapixels with flash. Overall, i rate this phone 9 out of 10.; I got this phone 2 days ago so far no problem with it except the battery.

Well I have bought this phone about two weeks ago, and I just have to say that I am really impressed about the device and its capabilities.
 Of course, there are some things that a normal user should do to improve the battery life (e.g. firmware upgrade, disable location, etc.)
 I have my enterprise e-mail on it, I use it for surfing the web using 3G connection and also Wi-Fi for about half an hour/an hour a day, moderate calls and the battery lasts easily 1.5 days or even 2.

It is a good device but is prone to heating and is more delicate to use than my old BlackBerry Curve 8520. On the other hand the display is absolutely brilliant and the phone is faster than my old BlackBerry. It is such a thing that you should be comfortable and willing to overlook the drawbacks and appreciate the good points. Overall I would give it a rating of 7/10.; It is a good device but is prone to heating and is more delicate to use than my old BlackBerry Curve 8520.

Got the Blackberry 9360 mid Dec 2011. The battery on this phone is absolutely PATHETIC, ATTROCIOUS! It barely lasts 2 hrs texting and browsing. I do not consider myself a heavy user. Its on charge all the time. A colleague at work has the same phone, same problem - he was forced to buy an additional battery to carry around and a car charger. I am forced to carry my old Sony Ericsson with me as backup. 
 
 I have lodged a complaint with my service provider with whom I have a 2yr contract that the phone is not fit for purpose. They tested the phone, agreed with my complaint and replaced my 1st 9360 with another. Same problem. I am on my way now to them to return the phone and swop for a Sony Ericsson Arc S.

I am particularly fond of this particular handset, and dislike the keys of the Bold series. This is the perfect handset, but I would really like to have the following improvements in it:
 
 -> A good 2000 mAh Li-Po battery. Even if it makes the phone a bit bulky, its fine.
 
 -> At least a 8 mpx continuous autofocus camera with video recording of 1080p @ 60 fps actual.
 
 -> At least 1gb RAM with 16 Gb of in-built memory.
 
 -> A minimum of 1Ghz processor.
 
 -> And please oh please give a physical cover for the micro-USB port.
 
 -> Also a Radio is not too much to ask for.

Before I bought this phone I looked at all the problems people had mentioned and I was really worried about getting the phone. 
 In my opinion it is fantastic. It's a blackberry and there are no new surprises. Its thin, very light, runs well on the new software and does everything a you expect a BB to do.
 In terms of the battery life, I have turned down the brightness and don't leave my wifi and bluetooth on when I dont need it. I have found the battery will last 2 days if I am careful.

Here is the Answer for cycle charge?
 
 The long and short of it is, If you charge your battery 50% now, then you disconnect the charger, then you connect it back for 20%, disconnect, and you connnect it back for 30%, that adds up to 1 charge cycle (50%+20%+30%=100%).
 Therefore, you need a full cycle, 0 to 100%, to constitute to 1 charge cycle.
 As for charging too often, well, this is a personal thing. Right now, I�m using my MBP plugged in. So far, so good. Only complaints, the processor slowdown (probably to control the heat); Here is the Answer for cycle charge?; The long and short of it is, If you charge your battery 50% now, then you disconnect the charger, then you connect it back for 20%, disconnect, and you connnect it back for 30%, that adds up to 1 charge cycle (50%+20%+30%=100%).; Therefore, you need a full cycle, 0 to 100%, to constitute to 1 charge cycle.; As for charging too often, well, this is a personal thing.

Why can't I update mine? It says, "no updates available"
 
 May I just say, this phone is great, but could have been EXCEPTIONAL if the battery is good. It can only last for, I guess, 4-5 hours, medium use.
 
 I don't understand..... This model has a great graphics, compared to the other models like torch 9800, and good os, with great speed! But why did they let the battery go down? The battery capacity is 1000 mAh. Obviously, the 1000 mAh battery can't take a 480x360 graphic compressed, a 800mHz processor, and an OS 7 (if it may contribute to the topic) into 1 day. AT LEAST ONE DAY! It would be better if they upgrade it to, at least, 1300 mAh. The old curve 9300 has higher battery capacity with 1100 mAh, if I'm not mistaken. I just don't get it.

Hi,
 I am a blackberry user for the past 10years, recently got Curve9360. With floods of other smartphone options around us main reason people buy BB is for its amazing Qwerty keypad. But I am so frustated with the 9360 having very had keypad, so irritating to attend calls due to green and red buttons are hard enough you will struggle to attend phone calls.
 
 The old models 8xxx all have great typing keypads, wonder why would they compromise on this very basic feature. So its a punishment for those who opt for cheaper version, does it cost lots of money to give the soft key for all models. So its only those pay lots of money with higher model elligible for soft keys.

I went in to a dealer to sign up for this phone & the assistant manager asked me not to take this phone since she was sitting with 6 Out- of- Box Failures and one device with which the customer had ignored the problem of "heating" and therefore had passed the 7-day replacement period.

I would appreciate some feedback from people using this Blackberry.

It`s true that it has a relatively small battery but I am sure you can get a hole day if you know how to use it, like turning 3G/Wi-Fi/bluetooth off when not using it, setting the brightness to a low level, closing apps that you don`t need for the moment. Many people don`t know about these things and they expect a good battery life with all these features enabled. However in my opinion the new OS7 plays an important role when it comes to battery life. I remember BB 9780 having the same problem when was released running OS6. The new OS needs to get more polished and with the future updates will be optimized for lower consumption. I really like this model, I like the BB OS, never had a blackberry phone but I look forward to buying one.; It`s true that it has a relatively small battery but I am sure you can get a hole day if you know how to use it, like turning 3G/Wi-Fi/bluetooth off when not using it, setting the brightness to a low level, closing apps that you don`t need for the moment.

jus bought this fone a week ago or so.... for nearly 20K Indian Rupees, i got my Samsung I9003 too which is now about 18K.... frankly only the battery in my samsung was the piss off else the specs were gr8 with a 1Ghz processor, 512 MB Ram.... 4GB inbuilt memory of which about 1.7GB was available to the user....
 here im getting a 800Mhz processor, 512 MB Ram.... 512 MB memory available to the user of whivh about 360 MB was already used for/by the system so i was getting jus close to 150 Mb or so to beef up my mobile, though i must say the usabilty and the weight of the fone is amazingly light and still holds well in ur hands, the plastic gloss screen is a real finger print magnet..... battery with heavy usage still lasts about a day for me, about 2.5-3 hours of browsing, 5 hours talk time, havent still run much of videos in it....
 on the business end, its given me gr8 ease to handle my mails and BB messenger is def a unique BB product.... 
 the bad part is no flash support on the browser and when i use more than 3-4 apps at the same time, major hanging problem....
 typing is quite good and easy thnx to the shape the keys have been designed....
 accessing some basic features and menu etc is gr8.... frankly when i tested my frnds BB 8520, didnt really find much differences btw the OS5 and OS7.... jus more like a few cosmetic differences.....
 Gaming is def no-no for the BB.... still love my samsung for that.... the music is quite good though, not one of the best speakers or the loudest but the sound is crystal clear, and the video quality is just gr8.... 
 the camera does lack some advanced features like ISO/white balance.... etc, some very very basic features... the good part is it has an LED flash and takes some nice pics, the pics had a very fine and soft look....
 some paid BB apps were really not so worth it, atleast the entertainment ones, but the business apps are gr8...
 on the other materialistic matters, the fone definitely looks very classy and stylish to show off, gr8 looks and design and pretty sturdy too and the finish quality is quite good, again not the best in the market but pretty good!!
 all in all id rate the mobile
 Battery=6/10
 Usage (Business) : 8.5/10
 Specs : 6/10
 Entertainment : 7/10
 style/design : 8/10
 
 all in all id rate this fone about a 6.5/10 whereas id rate my Samsung Galaxy SL I9003 an 8-8.5/10 of course compared to the fones around the same price bracket, lets leave some of the bigger beasts aside, one shudnt compare mice with lions :)

 You need to compare both at the nearest store to really see what I'm talking about...
 One more thing is the camera quality, 9780 has the best camera in BB with 5MP and auto focus (only equaled by torch series), so make it 3 reasons for me to choose 9780 over 9360; I would go with 9780 because of 2 things, first is obviously the battery life, and second would be the built quality.

The reviewer has said that the screen is HVGA what is NOT
 The difference between this phone and Galaxy something and HTC Status is that they simply have chosen a simple 3:2 screen and for that they've used a black strip around that to mimic a 4:3 (mostly up and down) that is not a good thing, link at the distance between row one of the qwerty keys and the bottom of the display, BB is the only company that knows this form factor so well and has used a 4:3 screen (480x360 not 320) screen and I think it appears good.
 I really respect BB's attitude for not copying iOS (as Droid is always doing) and despite the market pressures they have persisted for the people who are not interested in touch phones; The reviewer has said that the screen is HVGA what is NOT; The difference between this phone and Galaxy something and HTC Status is that they simply have chosen a simple 3:2 screen and for that they've used a black strip around that to mimic a 4:3 (mostly up and down) that is not a good thing, link at the distance between row one of the qwerty keys and the bottom of the display, BB is the only company that knows this form factor so well and has used a 4:3 screen (480x360 not 320) screen and I think it appears good.; I really respect BB's attitude for not copying iOS (as Droid is always doing) and despite the market pressures they have persisted for the people who are not interested in touch phones
This is my first BB phone and I'm in love with it. I previously used Samsung Galaxy Ace but just simply got tired of Android (I mean c'mon! Phone manufacturers keep on releasing new models eveery week and I don't earn millions to go with the flow and buy a new and updated model monthly!). I only use my phone for business and messaging and my BB Curve 9360 delivers what I need. I don't care much about the camera since I would only use it to update my photos in Facebook and Twitter. I didn't have a tinge of regret switching from SGA to Curve 9360 compared to the last time when I bought my Galaxy Ace where I was weighing if I made the right choice. My BB Curve has the features that I mostly need and use. I would always get compliments from my colleauges who are also BB users since my hone is definitely a looker and amazingly slim for a BB. I must say thanks GSMArena for the sound review and thanks to RIM for coming up with this beauty. My next plan is to buy a BB Playbook to pair with my Curve but then again, I am not closing my doors to Android since I also love that platform. All in all, having a Blackberry works wonders for me as a professional! I just hope it will come with a software update to improve its battery life but for the meantime, I can always bring my charger with me ;-) Looking forward to also get the new BB phones next year with BBX platform.; This is my first BB phone and I'm in love with it.

i have the bb 9360 for a few days, and im quite happy with the performance. i noticed if you do not use bbm or most of the other features all the time the battery last quite long. Its way better than the 8520, the only thing good about it is its price; i have the bb 9360 for a few days, and im quite happy with the performance. i noticed if you do not use bbm or most of the other features all the time the battery last quite long.

i dont know nothing about this phone but il just have to take a chance and experiance it because if it is an upgrade it should have advanced its featurs and they say the internet perfoms at high speeds,the camera takes beatiful pictures and i wanted the 9300 but its not available anymore but i rather take the latest member of the family 9360; i dont know nothing about this phone but il just have to take a chance and experiance it because if it is an upgrade it should have advanced its featurs and they say the internet perfoms at high speeds,the camera takes beatiful pictures and i wanted the 9300 but its not available anymore but i rather take the latest member of the family 9360

Surely this is the worse blackberry I've aver had. Design and feature is very good but battery is awefull, charge twice a day, very hot on the battery cap and you can make a fried egg on the back.

Got the phone after the Launch in Middle East. Brilliant sleek phone and the OS7 makes it a different experience all together. The 5MP camera seems useful and the works well in dark lights as well. Battery seems fine. However if u use it with 3G services it barely lasts half a day. Im using it with 2G network and the battery is much promising, goes almost a day with constant BBM and other IM chats. Hence, i recommend users to try with 2G band if you want more battery life. End of the day its a good deal and one of the best models Blackberry has made in the recent years..!!; Got the phone after the Launch in Middle East.

hello blackberry users. I loved blackberry, but this 9360 Apollo just broke my heart. Dont get me wrong this device is one sexy beast, with its thin body and bright LCD. I was seduced by the looks and the sexiness, but just like other sexy girl/boy this Apollo is just crap and will bleed your love.
 
 Firstly, the make quality of this 9360 is just sooooo baaaad. I sometimes want to throw it against the wall or stomp it with my boots.The keyboard is no good. Several keys/letters are so soft, that when you touch them slightly and letters will appear, and other keys are harder to press? Why RIM, why can't you make the keyboard have a more uniform feeling everywhere?
 
 The trackpad is so famous for being very, very loose. It will move left, right, up, down when you touch it. Trackpad will stick to your finger when you have sweaty thumbs. And it just feel so soft to press and enter using this trackpad.
 
 Ooh, do not forget about the lights leaking from the LCD and also dust getting between the LCD and the cover. This Apolly 9360 has a quality control problems.
 
 You want to buy Apollo 9360?? You better wait until the next batch of production comes out. Or don't buy Blackberry at all. This phone is just one bad news.; hello blackberry users.

This mobile is the cheapest feel mobile from RIM. Compare to this BB8520 feels much solid and decent handset. I loved 2 features of BB9360. 1) Camera though without autofocus takes really good pictures. 2) OS 7.0 though not very different to OS 6.xx feels refreshing. Rest all is bad news. The keypad is horrible and feels damn cheapy plastic. The dark paint on keypad peels off easily and you can see backlight leak from the alphanumeric keypad making it look really cheap. Built Quality of the phone itself feels very plasticky and cheap. The dust easily accumulates behind the screen making it look defective. My handset was made in Malaysia. I had to sell it off just in 3 days. What has happened to RIM. It would be better to have BB9780 rather than throwing away hard earned money on BB9360 or even BB9900 ( which also has many drawbacks ). But if you are on a budget, BB9300 or BB8520 are much better built devices.; This mobile is the cheapest feel mobile from RIM. Compare to this BB8520 feels much solid and decent handset.

The phone's pretty light compared to most Blackberry models. As for the battery, I don't mind, since I can always charge it with my laptop, and I bring my laptop anywhere I go. The battery may not be a powerhouse, but it lasts pretty reasonable if you're using the phone normally. A great phone overall. But don't buy this phone if your main priority is browsing, you should go for Torch or Android devices instead.; The phone's pretty light compared to most Blackberry models.

Bought it a few weeks ago. Here's my feedback :
 
 PROS:
 Very slim and stylish.
 Very light weight.
 Brilliant display thanks to Liquid Graphics Technology
 Loud and Clear audio with good EQ preset.
 Smooth and fast.
 OS 7
 NFC
 and much more.
 
 CONS:
 Very hard Menu and Return keys.
 Keypad is equally tight and squeky. Thumbs pain after some time.
 
 Battery backup is coming upto 16 hrs with Twitter, FB and BBM running in the background. Pretty good actually.
 Camera does not have Auto-Focus.
 
 Btw, I have typed it on my 9360 with Opera Mini ;)

My take is this price will go down possibly to 250 Euro within 6 months, so I will be patient with my 8520 Curve. But this is a must have phone, the battery I dont mind since I work with a PC I can always charge it. Those who complain about battery power have themselves to blame, I use battery intensively so I am prepared to charge it, if I will leave it with low to moderate use I am sure it can go for more than a day. An iphone battery is charged almost daily because these are communication intensive phones, they are always doing something by themselves e.g. updating twitter, facebook, contacts sync, BBM updates so the demand on power will be high. You cant have a small smartphone with very good battery unless it grows in size like the 4.0 inch phones.; My take is this price will go down possibly to 250 Euro within 6 months, so I will be patient with my 8520 Curve.

released in Indonesia yesterday. thinking about buying it since I need an affordable berry for my wife. but never imagine that the price could be more than US $300 (the fact is, official price > US $ 400 in Indonesia!) considering it was made in Malaysia (our neighbor that has chip factory, Indonesian professionals as worker, but worst berries market) should be a lot cheaper than (say...) US $280. 
 Maybe it's not wise to have bad judgement, considering that RIM has the best service for wireless internet via smartphone in Indonesia (Yes, there are some delays on the connections, but it doesn't occurs everyday. if bb down, all smartphone does), bunch of unsold stocks from other country that can be sale to Indonesians (so, there are still prehistoric bb sale as new phone) and the fact that Indonesia is the largest (insanely, still growing) bb market in Asia (the only one you can have to squeeze), . .

This phone looks awesome. I can�t wait to have one, I just have to save and make sure when it lands I will be able to get it. But at times SPs are greedy; I know in SA the Bold 9900 is going for close to $1428.00 for 24 months contract and $1142.00 for cash at private dealers, that�s just insane. Because of data usage, I LOVE Blackberry, saw Nokia, must be E7, doesn�t look good at all. When I was on Nokia my internet bill was $35 per month, now its reduced to about $9. Until maybe 2016 I won�t be thinking anything else not Blackberry.; This phone looks awesome. I can�t wait to have one, I just have to save and make sure when it lands I will be able to get it.

u just can't get good games with good camera and a good internet on your phone if you are going to buy a BB 
 i love the way that blackberrys look like 
 and RIM definitely has a plus with all the chatting,internet browsing stuff but it simply fail's when it come's to making mobiles 
 for teenagers unlike samsung they made the M pro with a qwerty a high camera with a faster processor and a screen that u could play HD games on it 
 they came up with the perfect appoint for the 9360 
 but instead the curve's high price the pro is cheaper and more fun to use 
 as i said before i was going to but the pearl cuz it had a good camera but i saw this one and isaid i've found the phone that fit's me but it has a price that don't fit me or most people xD i won't buy a blackberry only if they lowered there prices at least 20% if they stayed like that for so long there phones won't be sold anymore and that's what is happening now; u just can't get good games with good camera and a good internet on your phone if you are going to buy a BB; i love the way that blackberrys look like; and RIM definitely has a plus with all the chatting,internet browsing stuff but it simply fail's when it come's to making mobiles; for teenagers unlike samsung they made the M pro with a qwerty a high camera with a faster processor and a screen that u could play HD games on it; they came up with the perfect appoint for the 9360; but instead the curve's high price the pro is cheaper and more fun to use; as i said before i was going to but the pearl cuz it had a good camera but i saw this one and isaid i've found the phone that fit's me but it has a price that don't fit me or most people xD i won't buy a blackberry only if they lowered there prices at least 20% if they stayed like that for so long there phones won't be sold anymore and that's what is happening now

Pranav Raval AMD IND, 03 Sep 2011Hi Everybody..!! People are saying to throw away the Nokia handsets and go all out for BB..... moreDepends which country you're from & what you look for in a smartphone. BB is supposed to be pure business phone. It's great for texting & emails & good security features. I find the BB pricing too expensive for me & doesnt have the features I want like video & camera section. If I use the Blackberry Internet Service, I cant use it in other non BB phones. BIS isnt exactly cheap either.
 + I find the offline Nokia maps useful. I'm not big on BBM or chatting kinda stuff
 
 So, comparing BB, Nokia, SE, I went with Nokia. Those who choose BB will have their reasons, just like any other brand.; Depends which country you're from & what you look for in a smartphone.

You obviously have no idea what a blackberry actually is. Not everyone needs high mp cameras, most smartphones use 5mp or 8mp anyway. Plus Blackberry's don't need dual core as they run bb os, not android. Good chance bb os is not optimised for dual core hence what would be the point. Back to the drawing board for you mate.; Haha, you sell phones??? You obviously have no idea what a blackberry actually is. Not everyone needs high mp cameras, most smartphones use 5mp or 8mp anyway.

BB are the best in terms of email service.... they have real-time push of emails unlike the other brands of CPs you have to connect to internet before getting emails etc.... I know that BB features are lower than the other phones but BB is more classy... hihihi; BB are the best in terms of email service.... they have real-time push of emails unlike the other brands of CPs you have to connect to internet before getting emails etc....

this is why blackberry will not be market leaders.. they never bring out any spectacular. 5MP camera on there 2011-12 models? none of there new range of handsets have dual core processors.. and the apps store is still small? i dont see the point in me selling blackberries to customers anymore..

i had hopes about this phone that it won't be more expensive than the Pearl 3G which i was going to buy for about 2400L.E(livre egyptienne) a few months ago 
 but then i saw the ChaCha which had a better camera with a QWERTY keyboard and a cheaper price too 2000L.E 
 but i saw then (again) this phone that i really really loved !!! but samsung a few weeks ago came with the boom (samsung galaxy M pro) which has a faster processor and the same look of a BB they even 
 put the track-pad !!! but i had a shock a few weeks ago when i saw the price of this BB it's price was insane 2600LE >.< this is the same price of an Xperia Neo !!!! and all BBs r cheaper now the pearl is 1800LE and the 9300 is 1700,why the hell is this phone has that insane price ?!!!!!!! and having a BB in egypt ain't cheap after u buy it xD one day for BBM=5.5LE=1$ which is alot X( or u can pay 100LE=25$ for a month (without basic internet) on the other side is Android,symbian,windows mobile, one day of internet for these OSs costs 1LE=25 Cents but the BB is also one dollar for a day of internet that mean's in total u will pay 2$ a day for BB,internet 
 RIM is crazy i wonder y there phones r very expensive like that ? all there phones r plastic and has TFT screens 
 my hopes got down 2 times before but what really doesn't disappoint u is Samsung i hope the M pro won't be more than 330-350$ like the ChaCha which i think will be the phone that i'll buy XD; i had hopes about this phone that it won't be more expensive than the Pearl 3G which i was going to buy for about 2400L.E(livre egyptienne) a few months ago; but then i saw the ChaCha which had a better camera with a QWERTY keyboard and a cheaper price too 2000L.E; but i saw then (again) this phone that i really really loved !!! but samsung a few weeks ago came with the boom (samsung galaxy M pro) which has a faster processor and the same look of a BB they even; put the track-pad !!! but i had a shock a few weeks ago when i saw the price of this BB it's price was insane 2600LE >.< this is the same price of an Xperia Neo !!!! and all BBs r cheaper now the pearl is 1800LE and the 9300 is 1700,why the hell is this phone has that insane price ?!!!!!!! and having a BB in egypt ain't cheap after u buy it xD one day for BBM=5.5LE=1$ which is alot X( or u can pay 100LE=25$ for a month (without basic internet) on the other side is Android,symbian,windows mobile, one day of internet for these OSs costs 1LE=25 Cents but the BB is also one dollar for a day of internet that mean's in total u will pay 2$ a day for BB,internet; RIM is crazy i wonder y there phones r very expensive like that ? all there phones r plastic and has TFT screens; my hopes got down 2 times before but what really doesn't disappoint u is Samsung i hope the M pro won't be more than 330-350$ like the ChaCha which i think will be the phone that i'll buy XD
Pranav Raval AMD IND, 03 Sep 2011Hi Everybody..!! People are saying to throw away the Nokia handsets and go all out for BB..... moreBroo.. Come to Indonesia. You'll understand why people buy BB instead of Nokia. Indonesia is the biggest blackberry users and The second largest facebook users in the world. BB provides BIS which gives unlimited internet access with an affordable price. This gives flexibility for people to go online, especially facebooking. The most important thing is BBM. It simply connects people. Very Good for business. It is so easy to communicate with suppliers or consumers with BB. Basically using BB = more friends/networks = more money.; Broo..

Hi Everybody..!!
 
 People are saying to throw away the Nokia handsets and go all out for BB..
 
 
 Still I dunno understand WHY..???!!
 
 
 Nokia offers Symbian OS since a long period.. But so what.. At the same time Nokia has always pumped in it's efforts to give us variety of Handsets every now and then..!
 
 
 Against this, what the BB has offered to it's Users except a much higher price tag.. Along with the lookalike Body Chassis and outlook and OS and much slower CPU and with lesser compatibility with Free Apps on your BB Handset..???
 
 
 Just give a second thought while throwing away your Nokia and remember that even today also Nokia dominates and enjoys the largest market share on this planet..!
 
 
 We will find the reviews on Nokia that its not good.. But how many BB users are in majority who are happy..??!!
 
 
 Think again...!

Blackberry os7 is only supported with the new models that are coming out soon including this one so the older blackberry wont support it so everyone will try get the newer ones but then they realise that the cheapest new one is on preorder now is �300 so then they wont buy it then Blackberry's stocks goes down and the company goes bust .....
